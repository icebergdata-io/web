  "Title": "White Space Detection by Tracking Public Brand Presence",
  "Subtitle": "Uncovering Underserved Markets through Competitor Location Listings",
  "Business Impact": "Identifying geographic or demographic ‘white space’ can lead to a 15-25% revenue boost when businesses expand into areas with little direct competition.",
  "Sector": "Market Analytics",
  "What data was collected": "Public store locators on competitor websites, brand presence data on Google Maps, user queries about regional product availability, and population/demographic info from public records.",
  "Why this matters": "Knowing exactly where competitors dominate or underperform helps companies expand into locations where demand is high and rival coverage is thin.",
  "Implementation time": "6 to 10 weeks, involving competitor store locator scraping, demographic data correlation, and a mapping module that highlights potential market gaps.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Random site selection or expansion without competitor insight. 2) Overcrowded markets that lead to high competition and low margins. 3) Missed opportunities in regions where demand remains unfulfilled.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "A specialized scraping team can systematically collect competitor location data from public ‘Find a Store’ pages, ensuring accuracy and minimal manual overhead for your analytics staff.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object listing competitor store locator URLs, demographic metrics to fetch, and region filters. Example: { 'competitor_locators': ['CompetitorX.com/locations'], 'demographics': ['median_income'], 'regions': ['CA', 'TX'] }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON object mapping competitor coverage density, regional demand indicators, and recommended entry points. Example: { 'region': 'Northern California', 'competitor_coverage': 'Low', 'demand_score': 0.9, 'entry_suggestions': [...] }",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Competitor store coordinates are pinned on a map, then overlaid with demographic layers from public records, factoring in population size and median income for a composite ‘white space’ score.",
  "Story": "A sustainable home goods retailer wanted to expand beyond its existing territories, but worried about oversaturating markets. They hired a web scraping service to automatically retrieve competitor store addresses from each rival’s ‘Find a Store’ page. The resulting dataset was cross-referenced with public census data about income levels, population growth, and eco-conscious consumer indices. In certain neighborhoods, the brand discovered strong potential demand but minimal competitor presence—an ideal expansion zone. For instance, part of Northern California displayed higher-than-average interest in green lifestyles, yet competitor footprints were practically nonexistent. Using these insights, the retailer opened a pilot store in that region, combining strong local marketing with an appealing product mix. Sales exceeded projections, confirming that the data-driven location choice was sound. By outsourcing the scraping, the brand maintained an up-to-date competitor location map without having to manually check or replicate each store address. This continuous feed of location intelligence has since become a core pillar of their growth strategy, helping them navigate expansion with confidence in an increasingly crowded retail market.",
