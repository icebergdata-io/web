  "Title": "From Footsteps to Clicks: How a D2C Brand Increased AOV by 15% Using Pop-Up Store Traffic Analysis",
  "Subtitle": "Translating Physical Product Interaction Data into a High-Converting E-commerce Website Layout",
  "Business Impact": "Achieved a 15% increase in Average Order Value (AOV) and a 40% uplift in a key product category by redesigning the e-commerce homepage based on physical pop-up store engagement heatmaps.",
  "Sector": "E-commerce",
  "What data was collected": "Anonymized in-store Wi-Fi and computer vision sensor data (providing dwell times and traffic counts per display area), public social media check-ins for sentiment analysis, and the client's internal e-commerce sales data (SKUs, purchase times, geographic locations).",
  "Why this matters": "For digital-native brands, physical pop-ups are a data goldmine. Understanding which products draw real-world attention allows them to break out of online 'filter bubbles' and optimize their website layout to mirror genuine, unprompted customer interest, leading to higher engagement and sales.",
  "Implementation time": "10-12 weeks, which included sensor data API integration, developing geospatial correlation models, and building a dashboard to visualize in-store heatmaps alongside online conversion funnels.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Bridging the data gap between offline brand experiences and online sales performance. 2) Over-reliance on online-only metrics (like clicks) which may not reflect true product interest. 3) Ineffective website merchandising that fails to capitalize on products with high physical appeal.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Outsourcing to a data intelligence partner like Iceberg Data provides the expertise to handle and anonymize diverse sensor data streams and build complex correlation models. We manage the entire pipeline, from raw sensor pings to actionable e-commerce layout recommendations, a capability typically outside a D2C brand's core competency.",

  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "We employed a spatiotemporal matching algorithm. In-store sensor data, which provided anonymous device IDs and timestamps for dwell time near specific product displays, was correlated with the client's e-commerce data. We matched anonymized user sessions on the website from the same geographic region (city-level) occurring within a 72-hour window after a recorded high-dwell-time visit, identifying statistically significant uplifts in product page views and purchases.",
  "Story": "<p>Our client, a rapidly growing direct-to-consumer (D2C) fashion brand, faced a paradox of success. Their online store was thriving, driven by sophisticated digital marketing and an algorithm that expertly showcased their bestselling denim and basic tees. To expand their brand presence, they launched a series of beautifully designed physical pop-up stores in key urban markets. The problem? The pop-ups felt like a marketing expense, a data black hole completely disconnected from their core e-commerce engine. They knew people were coming in, but they had no idea what those visitors were <em>truly</em> interested in, or if the visit ever translated to an online sale.</p><p>The brand's leadership approached us with a unique challenge: could we turn their physical foot traffic into actionable data to optimize their e-commerce layout? They suspected their online 'bestseller' list was a self-fulfilling prophecy, driven by homepage placement, and that they were missing out on undiscovered product heroes. We saw this as a perfect opportunity to bridge the physical-digital divide.</p><p>Our first step was to instrument their flagship pop-up in SoHo, New York. We worked with their operations team to integrate data streams from their existing, privacy-compliant hardware: overhead computer vision sensors and Wi-Fi analytics points. <strong>This allowed our systems to anonymously track movement patterns, generating a real-time heatmap of the store.</strong> We weren't interested in who the customers were, but rather where they went, how long they stayed at a particular display (dwell time), and the overall flow through the space. Each product display, from the 'DENIM-VINTAGE-FIT' wall to the 'ACC-SILK-SCARVES' table, was geofenced in our system.</p><p>After running the data collection for one month, the results were startling and immediately valuable. The client's online store prominently featured their denim collection, which, as expected, received a high volume of foot traffic in the pop-up. However, the real story was in the dwell time data. While many people glanced at the jeans, <strong>the display with the highest average dwell time per interaction was a small, unassuming table of silk scarves and accessories.</strong> Online, this category was buried three clicks deep in the website's navigation and represented less than 5% of sales. In the real world, customers were physically drawn to it. They were picking up the scarves, feeling the texture, and spending significant time engaging with the product.</p><p>This was the 'undiscovered hero' the client was looking for. Our analysis showed that the 'ACC-SILK-SCARVES' display had a 30% higher average dwell time than any other display in the store. Using our spatiotemporal matching algorithm, we then correlated this anonymized in-store data with online behavior. We found that visitors from the NYC area who later visited the website showed an 8.2% higher propensity to convert on an accessory item compared to the baseline. The physical interaction was creating a powerful, unrealized purchase intent.</p><p>Armed with this data, we provided a clear recommendation, reflected in our output JSON: elevate the 'ACC-SILK-SCARVES' collection from a forgotten category to a primary feature on the e-commerce homepage. The client A/B tested a new homepage layout featuring a high-quality banner image of the scarves. The results were immediate and profound. <strong>Within two months, the company saw a 15% increase in their overall Average Order Value (AOV)</strong>, as customers were now adding a high-margin accessory to their typical denim or tee purchase. Sales for the accessory category itself skyrocketed by over 40%. By listening to the silent language of footsteps and dwell time, we helped an online-native brand discover a massive growth opportunity that was hiding in plain sight.",
