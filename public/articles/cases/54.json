  "Title": "Mapping Profitability: How Scraping Competitor Store Layouts Eliminated 'Dead Zones' and Increased High-Margin Sales by 18%",
  "Subtitle": "Utilizing publicly available store maps and promotional data to reverse-engineer competitor foot traffic strategies and optimize product placement.",
  "Business Impact": "Identified and eliminated low-traffic 'dead zones' by redesigning store layouts based on competitor intelligence, leading to an 18% increase in high-margin accessory sales and a 12% rise in overall basket size.",
  "Sector": "Retail",
  "What data was collected": "Publicly available digital store maps from competitor websites and mobile apps, weekly promotional flyer data, product category information, and geotagged customer photos from public review platforms (e.g., Google Maps) to validate zone popularity.",
  "Why this matters": "A store's physical layout directly impacts the customer journey and profitability. Without visibility into successful competitor strategies, retailers are blind to optimal product placement, leading to missed sales in high-margin categories and a poor customer experience.",
  "Implementation time": "10-12 weeks, including initial scraping of dozens of competitor store maps, building a parser to extract zone data, and developing a heatmap overlay model.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Underperformance of high-margin product categories. 2) Ineffective store layout changes based on gut-feel rather than data. 3) Lack of competitive intelligence on in-store customer flow and product discovery paths.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Manually collecting and digitizing hundreds of store maps is infeasible. An automated scraping solution can extract, standardize, and analyze layout data at scale, handling different map formats (PDF, PNG, interactive web elements) and correlating it with promotional data—a complex data integration task.",

  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "We employed Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and computer vision to parse static map images (PNGs, PDFs), identifying text labels for zones like 'Mobile Phones' or 'Gaming Accessories'. For interactive maps, we parsed the underlying DOM structure. This structured zone data was then geospatially correlated with scraped weekly promotions for those same product categories to create a 'promotional heat' score for each zone.",
  "Story": "<p>Our client, a major regional electronics retailer, faced a frustrating paradox. They were leaders in sales for big-ticket items like televisions, laptops, and gaming consoles, but their sales of high-margin accessories were inexplicably flat. Customers would come in for a specific large purchase and walk straight out, completely bypassing the sections for cases, cables, headphones, and warranties. Their internal data confirmed the problem—low basket size and poor attachment rates—but offered no clues as to why. They suspected their store layout was the culprit, creating 'dead zones' for these profitable items, but they were operating on gut instinct, not data.</p><p>The central challenge was clear: how could they optimize their store layout to guide customers naturally towards these accessories? They knew their competitors were succeeding where they were failing, but gaining intelligence on a competitor's in-store customer journey seemed impossible. You can't exactly install foot traffic sensors in someone else's store. This is where our team at Iceberg Data came in. We proposed a solution that didn't require a single sensor, relying instead on a vast, underutilized resource: publicly available web data.</p><p>Our strategy focused on reverse-engineering competitor store layouts at scale. <strong>We built a custom web scraping solution to systematically collect two critical types of public data from their top three national competitors:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Digital Store Maps:</strong> We targeted the 'Store Locator' and 'Store Information' pages on competitor websites and mobile apps. These sections often contained detailed maps for individual locations, presented as downloadable PDFs, static PNG images, or fully interactive web widgets.</p><p>2. <strong>Promotional Data:</strong> In parallel, our scrapers ingested and parsed weekly digital flyers, homepage promotional banners, and category sale pages. This allowed us to build a time-series database of which products and categories were being actively promoted.</p><p>The initial data harvest was diverse and unstructured. Our data engineering team's first task was to create a unified model. We used a powerful combination of <strong>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to 'read' the text labels on the static map images and DOM parsing to deconstruct the interactive JavaScript maps.</strong> This process allowed us to digitize hundreds of unique store layouts, creating a structured database that identified the precise location of key zones like 'Smartphones,' 'Home Audio,' 'Gaming Peripherals,' and, most importantly, the various accessory sections.</p><p>The breakthrough moment came when we overlaid the promotional data onto these digitized layouts. By correlating which product categories were on sale with their physical location in the store, we created a 'Promotional Adjacency' model. The insights were immediate and powerful. Our client had been scattering their accessories in a single, isolated aisle at the back of the store, far from the primary customer path. In stark contrast, we discovered that <strong>every single successful competitor engineered their layouts to create a seamless customer journey.</strong> They consistently placed high-value accessories (like premium headphones) directly adjacent to the anchor product category (smartphones and laptops). Furthermore, they created high-traffic 'impulse buy' zones for essential, lower-cost accessories like charging cables and screen protectors along the main pathways leading to the checkout counters. Their stores weren't just warehouses for products; they were carefully designed funnels.</p><p>Armed with this data-driven blueprint, our client launched a layout redesign pilot in 20 of their stores. They moved accessories out of their 'dead zone' and integrated them into the customer journey, mimicking the successful competitor models we had uncovered. The results were phenomenal. Within a single quarter, the pilot stores reported an <strong>18% average increase in accessory sales and a 12% lift in the average transaction value.</strong> Our 12-week project had provided them with an actionable, evidence-based strategy that debunked years of internal assumptions and unlocked a significant new revenue stream, proving that the secrets to optimizing your own store can often be found by intelligently analyzing the public data of others.",
