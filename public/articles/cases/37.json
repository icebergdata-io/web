    "Title": "Physical Store Layout Optimization from Public Foot Traffic Data",
    "Subtitle": "Scraping Community-Published Traffic Patterns to Improve Aisle Placement",
    "Business Impact": "Leveraging publicly available location data and consumer check-in info can lead to aisle reconfigurations that boost add-on sales by 15% and reduce congestion.",
    "Sector": "Retail",
    "What data was collected": "Geo-tagged check-in counts from social platforms, local business directories showing busiest times, competitor store images posted by customers, and in-store sensor data from the retailer’s premises.",
    "Why this matters": "Retailers can gain external perspective on foot traffic flows—like local events or peak-time insights from user check-in data. Combined with internal sensor logs, it reveals how best to design aisles.",
    "Implementation time": "6 to 8 weeks, including external foot traffic scraping, integration with internal store movement data, and recommended layout changes.",
    "Problems this solves": "1) Overlooking external influences like local events or competitor footfall spikes. 2) Reactive in-store layout adjustments without data on actual peak times. 3) Stagnant sales due to poor adjacency of product categories.",
    "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "A specialized web scraper handles retrieving foot traffic patterns from community sites while ensuring location data is used ethically and respects platform guidelines.",
    "Input Schema": "A JSON object specifying store geolocations, social check-in endpoints, competitor store references, and times of interest. Example: { 'store_coordinates': [ '37.7749,-122.4194' ], 'social_endpoints': ['...'], 'competitor_stores': ['StoreB'], 'time_frames': ['weekends'] }",
    "Output Schema": "A JSON object indicating peak foot traffic windows, recommended product re-zoning, and predicted sales uplift. Example: { 'store_id': 302, 'peak_traffic': 'Saturday 2-4pm', 'layout_changes': [...], 'sales_uplift_estimate': 0.15 }",
    "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Location-based matching merges public check-in times with store sensor logs. Product adjacency suggestions follow from linking high-traffic hours to category sales conversions.",
    "Story": "A regional supermarket chain had basic in-store sensors but wanted a fuller picture of foot traffic influences from surrounding businesses and local events. They enlisted a web scraping vendor to gather social media check-in data for nearby shops, restaurants, and event venues. The aggregated data showed that on Saturdays, foot traffic spiked at lunchtime when a popular farmer’s market opened next door. Understanding that wave, the supermarket repositioned grab-and-go meals and bakery items at the front, anticipating increased midday visitors. Meanwhile, competitor store images posted by customers hinted at successful produce aisle designs that funneled shoppers towards high-margin items like fresh juices. Incorporating these layout ideas, the chain improved the path to its own produce section, raising basket sizes. By outsourcing the scraping, the supermarket leveraged publicly accessible data without overburdening internal teams. Within weeks, managers saw less congestion near the registers and higher sales in impulse-buy sections. Ultimately, layering public foot traffic info on top of existing sensor data generated more nuanced store layout strategies, delighting shoppers with an easier flow and boosting revenue for the supermarket."
