  "Title": "OTA Commission Optimization through Public Price & Fee Scraping",
  "Subtitle": "Comparing OTA Fee Structures to Fine-Tune Hotel Channel Mix",
  "Business Impact": "Monitoring publicly advertised commission rates and listing fees can help hotels adapt channel strategies, potentially reducing OTA expenses by 10-15%.",
  "Sector": "Hotels",
  "What data was collected": "Public OTA listings and commission disclaimers, competitor brand promotions, visible discount structures, and user complaints about hidden fees on forums or social media.",
  "Why this matters": "OTAs may periodically adjust commission policies or offer special promotions to hotels, impacting final margins. Scraping publicly posted fees ensures that hotels negotiate or shift inventory intelligently.",
  "Implementation time": "8 to 10 weeks, covering aggregator scraping for multiple OTAs, analysis of competitor promotional tie-ins, and forecasting how fee changes impact direct bookings.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Blindly allocating inventory without knowing real-time OTA commission changes. 2) Failing to leverage competitor deals that hint at better or worse commissions. 3) Limited insight into how these fees affect overall profitability.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Professional web scrapers excel at capturing changes in publicly displayed fees or disclaimers across OTA sites, ensuring hotels are always up to date on commission fluctuations.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object with OTA site URLs, competitor hotel references, and commission highlight triggers. Example: { 'ota_listings': ['Expedia.com/hotels', 'Booking.com/hotels'], 'competitors': ['HotelX'], 'tracking_keywords': ['commission', 'listing fee'] }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON object summarizing each OTA's public fee structure, competitor tie-ins, and recommended channel allocations. Example: { 'ota_fees': [...], 'competitor_promotions': [...], 'channel_strategy': [{...}] }",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Data is grouped by OTA brand, location, and any unique disclaimers or promotional text referencing commissions or fees, then mapped back to competitor listings for side-by-side comparisons.",
  "Story": "A major hotel group found itself paying high commissions to certain OTAs but lacked the knowledge to confidently renegotiate or shift bookings to its website. By working with a web scraping agency, the group regularly pulled public commission details from multiple OTAs’ listing pages, T&C sections, and promotional disclaimers. The scraping process also captured competitor promotions that might reflect negotiated lower fees. In one instance, the data showed that a direct competitor brand had begun funneling more inventory to a specific OTA after that platform reduced listing fees. This acted as a strong indicator that the same OTA might be open to a similar deal. Additionally, user discussions on social media revealed dissatisfaction with hidden booking fees, suggesting certain OTAs were less transparent—potentially harming the user experience. Armed with this intelligence, the hotel group negotiated new terms with one OTA while transferring some inventory to direct channels and alternative booking platforms for better margins. By outsourcing the data collection, the brand stayed current on every public update—no matter how subtle—and made swift changes to its channel mix. The end result was a more balanced distribution strategy, reduced commission outflow, and improved profitability without risking the loss of vital OTA exposure.",
