  "Title": "From Queue to Keys: Streamlining Car Rental Pickups with Geospatial Foot Traffic Analysis",
  "Subtitle": "Leveraging publicly available Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signal data to eliminate bottlenecks and enhance customer experience at high-volume airport locations.",
  "Business Impact": "Resulted in a 25% reduction in average customer queue time, a 15% increase in ancillary service upsells at the counter, and a 10-point lift in Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores.",
  "Sector": "Car Rental",
  "What data was collected": "Aggregated, anonymized Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signal data from public data brokers covering airport terminals, competitor rental locations, and our client's counters. We also scraped public airport layout maps (PDFs and images) and geolocational data for points of interest within the terminal (e.g., baggage claim, gates, food courts).",
  "Why this matters": "In high-traffic airport locations, the physical layout of the rental counter directly impacts customer flow, wait times, and the opportunity for upselling. Understanding where customers come from within the terminal and how they linger allows for strategic placement of kiosks, premium vehicle displays, and promotional materials to maximize both efficiency and revenue.",
  "Implementation time": "12 to 14 weeks. This included initial data acquisition from public aggregators, scraping and digitizing airport maps, developing the geospatial correlation model, and deploying the visualization dashboard for the client's operations team.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Unidentified bottlenecks causing long customer queues and frustration. 2) Inefficient staff allocation based on anecdotal evidence rather than real-time demand patterns. 3) Missed upsell opportunities due to poor placement of marketing materials and premium service desks.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Acquiring and processing large-scale, anonymized geospatial and signal data is complex and requires specialized data broker relationships and infrastructure. Iceberg Data provided immediate access to this data and possessed the expertise to parse unstructured airport layout files and correlate them with foot traffic patterns, a capability far outside the client's core competency.",

  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "We employed a geospatial clustering algorithm (DBSCAN) to analyze the anonymized signal data points. These clusters were then overlaid onto digitized airport maps, which we created by scraping public PDF blueprints and using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to identify key landmarks. The algorithm correlated traffic density clusters with specific zones like 'Baggage Claim' or 'Security Exit' to map the primary customer pathways to the rental counters.",
  "Story": "<p>Our client, a leading global car rental company, faced a persistent and costly problem at its flagship airport locations: long lines. Despite being fully staffed and processing reservations efficiently, their customer satisfaction scores at these key hubs were plummeting. Travelers, weary from their flights, were met with frustrating queues, and the company was bleeding goodwill. They suspected the physical layout of their counters was to blame, but without concrete data, any expensive redesign would be a shot in the dark. They came to us with a critical question: how could they see the 'invisible' flow of people in the terminal to truly understand and fix their bottleneck problem?</p><p>The core challenge was a lack of visibility. The operations team relied on anecdotal observations from staff to manage queues. They knew when planes landed, but they didn't know the precise paths those passengers took to reach them. Did travelers from international arrivals behave differently than those from domestic gates? Where did people pause? Where was the optimal location for high-margin ancillary product displays like GPS units and child seats? Their existing setup was based on historical precedent, not on the actual, minute-by-minute behavior of their customers within the complex airport environment. They needed a data-driven blueprint for optimization.</p><p>Our team at Iceberg Data devised a multi-layered data collection strategy. First, we tapped into our network of public data brokers to source large-scale, anonymized Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signal data covering the entire airport terminal. This raw data provided the digital breadcrumbs of foot traffic. But these data points were meaningless without context. The crucial second step was to scrape the public websites of airport authorities and engineering firms for terminal layout maps, blueprints, and architectural PDFs. These unstructured files were the key to translating abstract data points into a physical map of human movement.</p><p>Next came the integration and analysis—our specialty. <strong>We deployed an automated system using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and image processing to digitize the static PDF maps, converting them into interactive, layered geographical information system (GIS) files.</strong> We identified and tagged key landmarks like gates, security checkpoints, restrooms, and, most importantly, baggage claim carousels. With the map digitized, we overlaid the anonymized signal data. Using a DBSCAN clustering algorithm, we could visualize the density and flow of people. We didn't just see a crowd; we saw pathways, dwell spots, and dead zones. For the first time, our client could see the complete customer journey from the airplane to their counter.</p><p>The 'aha' moment was immediate and striking. Our heatmaps revealed that over 70% of their customers arrived from a single international baggage claim area, following a very specific path. <strong>The data showed a massive bottleneck forming right at the entrance to their single-queue system. The average dwell time in this small zone was over 950 seconds—nearly 16 minutes.</strong> We could see that fast-moving, pre-booked loyalty members were getting stuck behind first-time international travelers with complex questions. Furthermore, their kiosk for ancillary services was located in a relative 'cold zone' that this main flow of traffic completely bypassed.</p><p>Armed with this clear, visual evidence, our client took decisive action. They didn't need a multi-million dollar renovation. Instead, they implemented our primary recommendation: they reconfigured their queue into two dedicated lanes, one a 'fast lane' for loyalty members and pre-paid customers, directly addressing the bottleneck we identified. They also relocated the ancillary services kiosk directly into the main customer pathway shown on our heatmaps. The results were transformative. Within a single quarter, the average customer queue time at that location dropped by 25%. The repositioned kiosk saw a 15% surge in upsells. Most importantly, their Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores for that location jumped by 10 points, reversing a year-long negative trend. By making the invisible flow of customers visible, we helped them turn a point of friction into a model of efficiency.</p>",
