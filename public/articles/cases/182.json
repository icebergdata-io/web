  "Title": "Increasing EV Station Utilization by 40% Through Geospatial Expansion Analysis",
  "Subtitle": "Leveraging Competitor, Point-of-Interest, and Local Sentiment Data to De-Risk Infrastructure Investment",
  "Business Impact": "Identified 50+ high-potential expansion sites for an EV charging network, leading to a projected 40% increase in average station utilization and a 15-month reduction in ROI time compared to previous site selection methods.",
  "Sector": "Market Intelligence",
  "What data was collected": "Competitor charging station locations from public maps, Point of Interest (POI) data for 'long-dwell' venues (malls, grocery stores), public EV-related discussions from local online forums and social media, commercial real estate listings, and aggregated EV registration data by zip code.",
  "Why this matters": "Selecting optimal locations for high-capital infrastructure like EV chargers is critical. Traditional methods miss nuanced local demand and the symbiotic relationship with nearby businesses. This data-driven approach ensures investment is directed to areas with proven demand, high traffic, and compatible nearby amenities.",
  "Implementation time": "12 to 14 weeks for initial data collection across five states, development of the scoring algorithm, and delivery of the interactive viability map.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) High-risk capital expenditure based on incomplete data. 2) Underperforming assets due to poor location selection. 3) Inability to quantify latent market demand in new territories. 4) Wasted time manually researching thousands of potential sites.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Outsourcing to a data partner provides the scale and expertise to scrape and synthesize thousands of disparate data sources—from geospatial coordinates on maps to unstructured text in local forums. An expert partner can build and maintain the complex scrapers and data pipelines needed for a continuous, up-to-date analysis.",

    "summary": "Scottsdale, AZ (85251) shows extremely high potential due to high EV ownership, strong concentration of long-dwell POIs (Fashion Square Mall), and vocal online demand for more fast chargers. Low competitor density in the immediate area presents a prime opportunity."
  },
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Geospatial correlation was the core method. Competitor locations, POIs, and available real estate parcels were geocoded and mapped. A radius-based analysis then linked these points to calculate a POI synergy score for each potential site. Natural Language Processing (NLP) with sentiment analysis was used on scraped forum text, which was then geotagged based on the forum's geographic focus (e.g., 'Phoenix subreddit') to create a demand sentiment heat-map.",
  "Story": "<p>Our client, a major electric vehicle (EV) charging network, faced a multi-million dollar paradox. They were in the midst of an aggressive national expansion, but their site selection process felt more like a gamble than a science. They relied on traditional metrics: highway traffic counts and broad demographic data. This led to costly mistakes—gleaming new charging stations sitting empty next to busy roads because they lacked what the industry calls 'dwell time opportunities.' A driver might pass the location, but they had no reason to stop and wait 30-45 minutes for a significant charge. The client needed to shift from simply finding available space to pinpointing the perfect ecosystem for a successful charging hub.</p><p>Our team at Iceberg Data was brought in to replace their guesswork with a data-driven strategy. We proposed a comprehensive solution: a proprietary 'EV Market Viability Score' that would rank every zip code in their target expansion states. This score would be a composite index, built from multiple, disparate public data sources that, when combined, would paint a clear picture of future success.</p><p><strong>The first layer of our analysis was mapping the entire competitive landscape.</strong> Our web scraping infrastructure systematically extracted the location, charger type, and operational status of every station from all major competitor networks. This gave us a near real-time, granular map of market saturation, immediately highlighting areas that were underserved versus those that were already a 'red ocean' of competition.</p><p><strong>Next, we focused on the crucial 'dwell time' factor.</strong> We built scrapers to collect Point of Interest (POI) data from public directories and mapping services, specifically targeting businesses where customers naturally spend 30 minutes or more. This included large grocery stores like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, shopping malls, cinemas, large gyms, and restaurant clusters. We geocoded hundreds of thousands of these POIs, allowing us to quantify the commercial vibrancy surrounding any potential site. A vacant lot by itself is worthless; a vacant lot next to a new Target and a Starbucks is a goldmine.</p><p><strong>The most groundbreaking component, however, was quantifying latent demand.</strong> How could we measure a community's *desire* for more chargers before breaking ground? Our team developed sophisticated NLP models to scan and analyze hyper-local online sources: city-specific subreddits, regional EV owner forums, and public community Facebook groups. We searched for keywords and phrases like 'charger broken again,' 'long wait for a charger,' or 'wish there was a fast charger near [shopping center name].' This unstructured text data was processed for sentiment and geotagged, creating a demand heat-map that showed us exactly where current EV owners were most frustrated and vocal about the lack of infrastructure.</p><p>Finally, we integrated two more data sets: aggregated, anonymized EV registration data from public state records to understand EV density, and data from commercial real estate sites to identify currently available parcels zoned for appropriate use. All these layers—competition, POI synergy, public sentiment, EV density, and land availability—were fed into our geospatial algorithm. For each potential location, the model calculated a final Viability Score, which we presented to the client on a dynamic, interactive map. They could now instantly see not just *where* to build, but precisely *why* a location scored an 88.5, as detailed in our JSON output example.</p><p>The business impact was immediate and profound. The client used our Viability Map to completely overhaul their expansion roadmap, prioritizing the top 50 highest-scoring locations for their next wave of investment. Early results from the first dozen stations built using this intelligence showed an average utilization rate <strong>40% higher</strong> than their historical network average. This dramatic increase in performance slashed their projected Return on Investment (ROI) period for each new station from 60 months down to just 45. By transforming their market expansion analysis from an art into a data science, we helped them de-risk their entire growth strategy and more effectively allocate hundreds of millions in capital.</p>",
