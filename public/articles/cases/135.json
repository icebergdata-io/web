  "Title": "Automating Multi-Jurisdictional Surcharge Audits: A Compliance Shield for Car Rental Aggregators",
  "Subtitle": "Leveraging Geo-Targeted Web Scraping to Ensure Partner Pricing Adheres to State-Specific Transparency Laws",
  "Business Impact": "Reduced potential exposure to regulatory fines by 95% and cut manual compliance auditing hours by over 400 per month, reallocating a 3-person team to strategic initiatives.",
  "Sector": "Car Rental",
  "What data was collected": "Publicly available pricing data from hundreds of car rental partner websites, including base rental rates, itemized mandatory fees (e.g., Airport Concession Recovery Fees, Vehicle License Fees, Tourism Surcharges), state and local taxes, and the final advertised total price for various vehicle classes and rental durations across 200+ U.S. jurisdictions.",
  "Why this matters": "Car rental pricing is notoriously complex, with a web of local and state-level mandatory fees. For aggregators, ensuring that their partners' advertised prices are fully transparent and inclusive of all required charges is a critical legal obligation to avoid consumer protection lawsuits and hefty fines for deceptive advertising.",
  "Implementation time": "12 to 14 weeks, which included building a database of jurisdiction-specific fee regulations, developing robust scrapers for diverse partner website structures, and creating a discrepancy-flagging dashboard for the client's legal team.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) High risk of non-compliance with varied state laws like California's AB-3141. 2) Inaccurate 'total price' displays, leading to customer distrust and cart abandonment. 3) Enormous, error-prone manual effort required to audit thousands of partner listings. 4) Legal liability for the aggregator due to partners' misleading pricing practices.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "An expert web scraping partner provides the sophisticated infrastructure needed for large-scale, geo-targeted data collection. This includes managing a vast network of residential proxies to simulate bookings from specific airports or cities, handling complex anti-bot measures on rental sites, and normalizing data from hundreds of different HTML layouts into a single, structured format.",

    }
  },
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "A rules-based engine cross-references scraped fee names against a proprietary database of legally mandated surcharges for each airport and city jurisdiction. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to identify fee variations (e.g., 'VLF' vs. 'Vehicle License Fee'). The algorithm then sums the base rate with all identified mandatory fees and taxes to generate a 'Calculated Total,' which is compared against the 'Displayed Total' on the partner's site. Any mismatch triggers a non-compliance flag.",
  "Story": "<p>Our client, a leading car rental aggregator in North America, was facing a silent but existential threat. Their business model relies on aggregating listings from hundreds of independent and franchise rental partners. While this provides customers with choice, it created a massive compliance headache. Each state, and often each major airport, has its own unique set of mandatory surcharges and fees that must be included in the advertised price. New consumer protection laws were putting the onus on the aggregator to ensure the prices displayed on their platform were not deceptive.</p><p>The client's Head of Legal and Compliance explained their predicament. 'We were spending thousands of hours manually spot-checking our partners,' she told us. 'A team of three auditors would spend their entire week pretending to book cars in different cities—from LAX to JFK to DFW—just to see if our partners were including the 'Airport Concession Fee' or the 'Tourism Surcharge' in the total price. It was inefficient, impossible to scale, and we knew we were missing things. One major lawsuit could jeopardize our entire business.' They were terrified of 'drip pricing' accusations, where a low initial price entices customers, only for mandatory fees to be added at the last step of the booking process.</p><p>Our challenge at Iceberg Data was to build an automated shield for them. We needed to create a system that could audit thousands of listings across hundreds of jurisdictions daily, flagging any partner who wasn't playing by the rules. The core of our solution was a sophisticated, geo-targeted web scraping engine. We configured our crawlers to simulate users from specific locations, which is critical because many rental websites display different fees based on the user's IP address.</p><p><strong>First, we built a comprehensive 'Regulatory Fee Database'.</strong> Our team researched and cataloged all known mandatory car rental fees for the top 200 airports and downtown locations in the US. This database became our ground truth. It listed fees like the 'Consolidated Facility Charge' in Las Vegas or the 'Customer Facility Charge' at Denver International Airport.</p><p><strong>Next, we deployed our scrapers.</strong> These weren't simple data extractors. They were designed to navigate the entire booking process on each partner site, right up to the final payment page, to capture a fully itemized price breakdown. They extracted the base rate, every line item listed under 'fees' or 'surcharges,' and the final, bold-print 'Total Price' shown to the customer. This process was repeated for different car classes and rental durations to ensure compliance across the board.</p><p>The real magic happened when the scraped data hit our matching algorithm. For each audit, the system would look at the jurisdiction (e.g., 'NV-LAS' for Las Vegas) and pull the corresponding required fees from our database. It would then parse the scraped fees from the partner site, sum them with the base rate and taxes, and compare this calculated, compliant total with the total the partner was actually displaying. The output was simple and powerful: a dashboard with a clear 'is_compliant' flag for every single partner listing we audited. When the flag was false, as shown in the example JSON, it detailed exactly which fee was missing and the monetary discrepancy.</p><p>The results were immediate and impactful. Within the first month, our system identified that nearly 15% of partner listings had some form of compliance issue, ranging from minor miscalculations to the blatant omission of significant surcharges. The client used this data to automatically notify non-compliant partners, giving them a deadline to correct their pricing displays before being delisted. <strong>This proactive approach reduced their potential fine exposure by an estimated 95% and completely eliminated the need for their manual audit team</strong>, freeing up those employees to focus on higher-value contract negotiations. It transformed their compliance strategy from a reactive, manual chore into a proactive, automated, and data-driven function, protecting both their customers and their bottom line.",
