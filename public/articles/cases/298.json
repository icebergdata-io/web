  "Title": "Boosting Pharmacy OTC Sales by 22% by Correlating Public Health Data with In-Store Patient Flow",
  "Subtitle": "Using Web-Scraped Local Health Data to Optimize Aisle Placement and Improve Patient Experience",
  "Business Impact": "Achieved a 22% increase in over-the-counter (OTC) product sales and reduced average prescription wait times by 15% through data-driven store redesigns based on correlated health trends.",
  "Sector": "Healthcare",
  "What data was collected": "Publicly available regional health reports (e.g., flu activity, allergy season severity) from government health portals, competitor pharmacy service offerings and hours from their websites, anonymized social media mentions of common ailments (e.g., 'cough', 'fever') geolocated to store vicinities, and the client's internal anonymized foot traffic sensor data.",
  "Why this matters": "A pharmacy's layout directly impacts patient experience and profitability. Understanding *why* a patient visits—whether for a prescription during a flu spike or for allergy medication—allows for strategic placement of relevant OTC products, improving convenience and driving incremental sales.",
  "Implementation time": "10 to 12 weeks. This included setting up scrapers for various regional health data sources, developing a geospatial correlation engine, and integrating the insights with the client's internal analytics platform.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Inefficient store layouts that frustrate sick patients. 2) Missed cross-selling opportunities for relevant OTC products. 3) Poor inventory planning for seasonal health products. 4) Lack of data to justify high-value product placement.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Outsourcing to a data partner provided the expertise to navigate and aggregate disparate public health data sources across hundreds of jurisdictions. Iceberg Data's infrastructure handles the complexity of geolocating unstructured social media data and normalizing health reports into a consistent format for analysis.",

  },
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Geospatial correlation was used to link public health data and geolocated social media mentions to specific store locations within a 5-mile radius. A time-series analysis then matched spikes in local health trends (e.g., a rise in flu cases) with corresponding changes in the client's internal foot traffic patterns and dwell times in specific store aisles.",
  "Story": "<p>Our client, a leading national pharmacy chain, faced a subtle but persistent challenge. Their stores were profitable, but customer satisfaction scores were stagnant, and sales of high-margin over-the-counter (OTC) products had plateaued. Internally, they knew their store layouts were a significant part of the problem. They were designed more like convenience stores than healthcare hubs, forcing sick patients seeking prescriptions to navigate a maze of cosmetics, seasonal decorations, and snack aisles. They had invested heavily in in-store sensors that provided a wealth of foot traffic data—heatmaps, dwell times, pathing—but this data existed in a vacuum. It told them <strong>what</strong> customers were doing, but not <strong>why</strong>.</p><p>This is where our team at Iceberg Data came in. During our initial consultation, we proposed a novel strategy: what if we could enrich their internal sensor data with external, real-time public health intelligence? The client's team was intrigued. Their current layout decisions were based on historical sales data and gut feelings. The idea of using predictive, external factors to design a more empathetic and efficient patient journey was a paradigm shift.</p><p>Our first step was to build a comprehensive data collection engine. We deployed crawlers to continuously scrape publicly available data from hundreds of sources, including the CDC's weekly flu reports, regional allergy pollen counts from meteorological sites, and local public health department bulletins. Crucially, we also monitored anonymized, geolocated social media mentions for keywords related to common ailments like 'fever,' 'cough,' and 'sore throat.' Each piece of external data was tagged with precise geographic coordinates and timestamps.</p><p><strong>The real magic happened when we integrated this external data stream with the client's internal foot traffic analytics.</strong> Using a geospatial and time-series correlation algorithm, we began to uncover powerful patterns. For example, our system would detect a 'High' intensity score for 'Influenza-Like Illness' in a specific cluster of zip codes. Within 48 hours, our analysis of the client's data for stores in that exact area showed a 40% spike in visitors who walked directly from the entrance to the pharmacy counter, spending an average of less than two minutes in the rest of the store. Their pathing data showed clear 'desire lines' that completely bypassed the core OTC aisles.</p><p>One of our most significant findings was the 'journey of frustration.' In stores where the 'Cold & Flu' aisle was located at the back, we saw high dwell times in that aisle, but the overall patient journey was long and inefficient. Sick customers were forced to navigate the entire store to find the relief they needed. This was a poor experience and a massive missed opportunity for the client.</p><p>Armed with this insight, we recommended a pilot program for 50 stores in high-variance regions. Our dashboard provided each store manager with weekly layout recommendations based on localized health trends. When our system flagged a rising flu trend, the recommendation was to create a prominent 'Cold & Flu Relief' end-cap display directly in the path to the pharmacy. When allergy season hit, that same high-visibility space was transformed to feature antihistamines, eye drops, and tissues. This dynamic, data-driven approach replaced the static, season-long planograms they had used for years.</p><p>The results were astounding. Over a six-month period, the pilot stores saw a <strong>22% average increase in sales of targeted OTC categories</strong> compared to a control group. More importantly, the average time for a prescription-only visit dropped by 15% because patients could find what they needed more efficiently. Customer satisfaction scores in the pilot stores climbed by over 10 points. By looking outside their own four walls and leveraging public data, we helped our client not only optimize their store layout for profit but also create a more compassionate and responsive healthcare environment for their patients.</p>",
