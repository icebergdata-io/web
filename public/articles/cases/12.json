  "Title": "Social Media Insights for B2B Leads",
  "Subtitle": "Extracting Data from Platforms Like LinkedIn to Identify High-Potential Prospects",
  "Business Impact": "By systematically harvesting social media information, sales teams can more effectively engage with decision-makers and influencers, translating into increased conversion rates and shorter sales cycles.",
  "Sector": "Lead Generation",
  "What data was collected": "Professional profiles, job titles, work history, and industry affiliations from LinkedIn and similar platforms, focusing on B2B contexts and corporate decision-making roles.",
  "Why this matters": "LinkedIn profiles often reflect up-to-date career information, allowing businesses to identify potential leads by role changes, new hires, or expansions—key indicators of a company’s readiness to invest.",
  "Implementation time": "6 to 8 weeks, covering compliance checks, building scraper APIs, and establishing data pipelines into the CRM or marketing automation system.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Reliance on outdated or unreliable lead databases. 2) Difficulty in discovering new hires or role changes quickly. 3) Limited visibility into the organizational hierarchy of target accounts.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "The outsourced team was well-versed in navigating social media platforms without violating terms of service, using stealthy scraping techniques and respecting data privacy regulations. This limited the risk of account bans and compliance breaches.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object with the target industry, job roles, and location preferences. Example: { 'industry': 'Software', 'job_roles': ['CTO', 'VP Engineering'], 'locations': ['San Francisco'] }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON array with structured lead information, including profile links and summary stats (years of experience, endorsements). Example: [ { 'name': 'Jane Smith', 'title': 'VP Engineering', 'company': 'TechDrive', 'location': 'San Francisco', 'profile_link': '...' }, ... ]",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Profile-based scraping that cross-references job roles and industries, applying text classification to filter out irrelevant titles and using location-based matching for regional targeting.",
  "Story": "A global IT solutions provider wanted to break into new markets. Although they had a robust sales team, their approach to identifying and prioritizing leads often felt haphazard. Knowing that LinkedIn is a key platform for professionals, they commissioned an outsourced data intelligence service to develop a system that continually scanned the platform for high-potential profiles. The system identified individuals based on location, job title, experience level, and connections to relevant tech communities. A daily feed synced with the provider’s CRM, adding newly discovered leads or updating job changes among existing contacts. This real-time intelligence became instrumental for account-based marketing campaigns. For instance, if an existing account contact became a CTO at a new firm, the system flagged this transition, enabling a timely and well-informed outreach. Within months, the provider reported a notable uptick in new business opportunities, thanks in large part to the targeted approach that focused on capturing real-time changes in professional roles—one of the strongest indicators of a readiness to adopt new solutions. By outsourcing the project, the IT solutions provider spared itself from the technical and regulatory complexities of scraping social media. The vendor managed best practices to avoid breaching user privacy and platform terms. Freed from these burdens, the provider’s sales teams could focus purely on nurturing relationships with the newly discovered leads. The result was a more strategic, data-driven approach that transformed LinkedIn into a fertile source of high-quality B2B prospects.",
