  "Title": "Maximizing Cart Value: A Dynamic Pricing Model for Accessory Cross-Sells",
  "Subtitle": "Using Competitor Basket Analysis to Boost Average Order Value by 18% in Consumer Electronics",
  "Business Impact": "By analyzing competitor bundle pricing and public demand signals for product combinations, our client optimized their cross-sell promotions, leading to an 18% increase in Average Order Value (AOV) and a 12% rise in accessory attachment rates.",
  "Sector": "Retail",
  "What data was collected": "Prices of primary products (e.g., gaming consoles, laptops) and associated accessories from 15 key competitor e-commerce sites. Publicly posted user 'builds' or 'setups' from tech forums and Reddit (e.g., r/buildapc, r/battlestations). Promotion details and bundle configurations from competitor marketing pages. Publicly available stock levels for high-demand accessories.",
  "Why this matters": "Static, one-size-fits-all promotions on accessories fail to capture maximum value. Understanding the dynamic relationship between a core product and its ecosystem allows for intelligent pricing that encourages bigger purchases without excessive discounting, directly boosting AOV.",
  "Implementation time": "10 to 12 weeks. This included building custom scrapers for competitor product pages, developing a natural language processing (NLP) model to identify product combinations in forum posts, and creating an API to feed pricing recommendations into the client's e-commerce platform.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Revenue leakage from poorly priced accessory promotions. 2) Inability to react to competitor bundling strategies in real-time. 3) Missed cross-sell opportunities due to a lack of data on which products customers naturally pair together.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Scraping complex e-commerce sites with dynamic pricing and anti-bot measures is a specialized skill. Furthermore, processing unstructured text from forums to accurately identify product SKUs and their relationships requires sophisticated NLP and entity recognition capabilities that are outside the core competency of a retail team.",

  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Product SKUs from the client's catalog were matched to competitor product pages using a combination of UPC/EAN code extraction and fuzzy string matching on product titles. For forum data, a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model was trained to identify product names and model numbers in unstructured text, which were then mapped back to the client's SKUs.",
  "Story": "<p>Our journey with a leading consumer electronics retailer began with a classic, yet deceptively complex, problem. They were masters at marketing big-ticket items—the latest gaming consoles, flagship smartphones, and high-end laptops. Their product launch campaigns were legendary. Yet, post-launch analysis consistently revealed a nagging issue: their Average Order Value (AOV) was flat. Customers would buy the hero product, but their strategy for selling the highly profitable accessories—controllers, cases, headsets, software—was failing.</p><p>Their approach was blunt. They'd either offer a flat 10% discount on all accessories with the purchase of a new console or none at all. This binary strategy was based on gut feelings, not data. They were either giving away margin unnecessarily on items customers would have bought anyway, or they were failing to nudge ambivalent buyers into making that extra purchase. They knew they were leaving millions on the table, but they lacked the visibility to create a more nuanced strategy.</p><p>This is where our team at Iceberg Data came in. We proposed a new way of looking at the problem: <strong>instead of just pricing a single product, let's price the entire customer basket dynamically.</strong> To do this, we needed to understand the hidden relationships between products. What accessories did customers *naturally* want to buy with a specific console? How were competitors bundling these items? What was the real-world demand for these combinations?</p><p>We deployed a two-pronged data collection strategy. First, our web scraping infrastructure targeted the e-commerce sites of their top 15 competitors. We didn't just grab the price of the main console, like the 'GCONSOLE-X2-PRO'. We captured the price of every related accessory, noted official bundle deals, and even monitored stock levels to gauge demand. This gave us a clear view of the competitive landscape.</p><p>The second prong was more innovative. We knew that the most valuable insights often come directly from the community. Our scrapers began monitoring enthusiast forums and subreddits where users post their 'builds' and 'setups'. Using a custom-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) model, we parsed thousands of these unstructured posts. Our system learned to identify when a user mentioned buying the 'CTRL-X2-ELITE' controller and the 'HSET-GAMING-A1' headset alongside their new 'GCONSOLE-X2-PRO'. By aggregating this data, we could assign a 'sentiment score' or 'pairing strength' to every possible product combination.</p><p>The results were revelatory. We found that certain products, like the highly anticipated game 'GAME-CYBERPUNK-X2', were almost always purchased at full price with the new console. The client had been needlessly discounting it. Conversely, the 'CTRL-X2-ELITE' controller was a key purchase driver; customers who saw a compelling discount on it were significantly more likely to complete the purchase. Our data showed that competitors were already offering 10-12% discounts on it, so our client's flat 10% was just table stakes, not a compelling offer.</p><p>We integrated this intelligence into a simple API. The client's e-commerce system could now send us a core product SKU and a list of accessories, and our API would return a set of dynamic pricing recommendations, complete with the rationale behind each one. For the 'CTRL-X2-ELITE', we recommended a sharper <strong>15% discount</strong> to beat the competition. For the 'HSET-GAMING-A1' headset, which had moderate pairing sentiment, a smaller <strong>10% discount</strong> was enough to convert. And for the 'GAME-CYBERPUNK-X2', we recommended <strong>zero discount</strong>, protecting their margins on a guaranteed seller.</p><p>Within the first quarter of implementation, the results were staggering. The retailer saw an <strong>18% increase in Average Order Value</strong>. The accessory attachment rate—the percentage of core product sales that included at least one accessory—jumped by 12%. By moving from a strategy of guesswork to one powered by real-world competitive and community data, the client transformed their promotional blind spot into a powerful engine for profit growth.</p>",
