  "Title": "Omnichannel Footfall Analysis by Tracking Public Mentions & Store Check-ins",
  "Subtitle": "Aligning Digital Marketing With Real-World Store Visits",
  "Business Impact": "By correlating in-store footfall data with public digital check-ins and social media mentions, retailers can adjust promotions to boost overall sales by 10-15%.",
  "Sector": "Retail",
  "What data was collected": "Publicly visible store check-ins on social media (e.g., Facebook), user posts tagging store locations, competitor footfall statistics from public news or aggregator sites, and internal sensor data.",
  "Why this matters": "Foot traffic is increasingly influenced by online buzz. Tying public store mention trends to offline visitor counts ensures marketing campaigns stay relevant and well-timed.",
  "Implementation time": "8 to 10 weeks, needing social platform scraping for location-based mentions, data correlation with internal store sensors, and a campaign analysis dashboard.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Disconnected online vs. offline performance insights. 2) Poor event planning due to unknown store visitation patterns. 3) Inability to measure how public hype correlates with actual visits.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "A web scraping partner navigates social media’s advanced location queries, consistently capturing public mentions of the store and competitor check-ins that can be tricky to track manually.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object listing brand-related hashtags, store geotags, competitor references, and the time frames to scrape. Example: { 'hashtags': ['#ShopXYZ'], 'geotags': ['StoreLocation1'], 'competitors': ['StoreABC'], 'time_frames': ['weekend'] }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON object correlating mention spikes with footfall changes, competitor insights, and recommended marketing actions. Example: { 'location': 'StoreLocation1', 'mention_spike': 'Saturday 5pm', 'footfall_delta': 0.12, 'marketing_suggestions': [...] }",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Social posts tagged with a location or brand hashtag are matched to store coordinates. Footfall sensor logs are cross-referenced by time to detect correlation between online buzz and offline visits.",
  "Story": "A regional clothing chain noticed certain days had unusually high foot traffic, though promotional calendars indicated no special sales. To understand why, they hired a web scraping service that monitored social media geotags and brand hashtags in real time. The data showed a pattern: local influencers would occasionally post from the store, spiking mentions by curious followers. The correlation to in-store visits was immediate—foot traffic would jump within hours of such a post. Conversely, a competitor’s store across town had pre-planned events generating check-ins, overshadowing the chain’s location on weekends. With this intelligence, the clothing chain started orchestrating micro-promotions whenever mention volume climbed, like flash sales or influencer partnerships to amplify the buzz. By outsourcing social media scraping, the marketing team had accurate, up-to-date metrics on how social chatter translated into offline visits. Within a few months, the chain synchronized online and offline efforts more effectively, boosting weekend foot traffic and average purchase size. In short, public check-in data and brand mentions became key indicators of real-world momentum, enabling quick action to entice and retain walk-in shoppers.",
