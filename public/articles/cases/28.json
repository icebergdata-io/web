  "Title": "High-Level B2B Lead Extraction from Public Speaker Agendas",
  "Subtitle": "Scraping Conference Schedules to Connect with Industry Thought Leaders",
  "Business Impact": "Reaching out to speakers who publicly appear at industry summits can bolster top-of-funnel leads, especially if those individuals hold key decision-making roles.",
  "Sector": "Lead Generation",
  "What data was collected": "Public speaker rosters, session abstracts, social media announcements from event organizers, and visible LinkedIn profiles referencing scheduled speaking engagements.",
  "Why this matters": "Conference speakers typically shape or lead strategies within their companies. Capturing public info on where and when they speak can open doors to significant partnerships or sales opportunities.",
  "Implementation time": "4 to 6 weeks, focusing on event website scraping, speaker detail extraction, and cross-referencing LinkedIn for role verification.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Time-consuming manual checks of event pages. 2) Overlooking influential individuals who only speak at niche or virtual events. 3) Missed relationship-building opportunities if outreach happens too late.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Professional event scrapers keep track of changing agendas, last-minute speaker additions, and do so in a policy-compliant manner to compile fresh leads for each conference.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object with conference URLs, target speaker roles, and desired sectors. Example: { 'summit_pages': ['https://cybersummit.com/agenda'], 'target_roles': ['CISO', 'CTO'], 'industry': 'Cybersecurity' }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON array listing speaker names, job titles, companies, and public links. Example: [ { 'name': 'Dr. Alice Carter', 'title': 'CISO', 'company': 'SecureNow', 'linkedin': '...', 'session_time': '2025-04-10 10:00AM' }, ... ]",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Agenda items are parsed for speaker details; any LinkedIn or social handle is validated for accurate job titles. Additional metadata helps rank speaker influence (e.g., session keynotes).",
