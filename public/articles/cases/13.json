  "Title": "Competitive Fleet Rotation using Public Rental Listings",
  "Subtitle": "Scraping Competitor Webpages to Optimize Vehicle Distribution",
  "Business Impact": "By collecting publicly available fleet data from competitor websites, car rental agencies can proactively rotate vehicles to meet local demand, increasing overall utilization by about 15%.",
  "Sector": "Car Rental",
  "What data was collected": "Public web listings of available vehicles, competitor branch locations, rental categories, and posted rental rates, all sourced from competitor websites and aggregator portals.",
  "Why this matters": "Location-specific information often changes quickly. Real-time insights from competitor sites help identify oversupplied or undersupplied vehicle segments, enabling data-driven rotation decisions.",
  "Implementation time": "6 to 8 weeks, including scraper development for competitor sites, data normalization, and integration with existing fleet management dashboards.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Guesswork in matching supply with demand. 2) Overlooked opportunities to fill short-term spikes in vehicle requests. 3) Reactive rather than proactive fleet transfers.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "A dedicated web scraping company has proven expertise in collecting accurate, real-time competitor data without violating site terms, ensuring consistent updates and robust coverage.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object with competitor URLs, the vehicle categories to track, and scraping frequency. Example: { 'competitor_sites': ['https://competitorA.com', 'https://competitorB.com'], 'vehicle_categories': ['SUV', 'Sedan'], 'scrape_interval': 'daily' }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON object listing each location, available vehicle types, suggested rotations, and expected gains. Example: { 'location': 'LAX', 'available_competitor_vehicles': [...], 'rotation_recommendations': [...], 'utilization_boost': 0.15 }",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "A location-based matching engine that compares competitor listings with internal data, prioritizing moves to branches reporting high demand and low inventory for specific categories.",
  "Story": "<p>For a mid-sized car rental firm, mismatches between vehicle supply and customer demand were hurting both satisfaction scores and profitability. Premium SUVs sat idle at some locations while constantly running low at others. The company knew that optimizing fleet distribution was crucial, but manual tracking of competitor data was time-consuming and often led to incomplete insights.</p>\n\n<p>To tackle this challenge head-on, the firm partnered with Iceberg Data's web scraping experts. The team developed a custom scraper that collected publicly available data on competitor vehicle inventories and pricing every few hours. This near-real-time data provided a comprehensive view of the competitive landscape, enabling the rental firm to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Identify demand surges, especially for premium models near business districts</li>\n  <li>Proactively relocate SUVs to high-demand locations just before peak hours</li>\n  <li>Align supply more closely with local demand patterns</li>\n  <li>Reduce unnecessary and costly vehicle shuttles between locations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Iceberg Data's approach ensured fast, reliable, and compliant data collection that respected each competitor's site terms. The scrapers accepted JSON input specifying competitor URLs, vehicle categories to track, and scraping frequency. The output provided clear JSON-formatted recommendations for each location, including suggested vehicle rotations and projected utilization boosts.</p>\n\n<p>A sophisticated matching engine compared competitor data with the client's internal supply, prioritizing transfers to branches with high demand but low inventory for specific vehicle types. This maximized the impact of each rotation while minimizing overall transfer costs.</p>\n\n<p>The results of this data-driven optimization were substantial. By ensuring premium SUVs were available when and where needed, the firm boosted vehicle utilization by <strong>15%</strong> while significantly improving customer satisfaction scores. Operational costs also fell as unnecessary transfers were eliminated.</p>\n\n<p>Iceberg Data's targeted web scraping solution allowed the client to harness competitor data for a measurable competitive advantage. With vehicles better matched to local demand, the firm increased revenue, cut costs, and delivered a superior rental experience. The <strong>15% increase in fleet utilization</strong> and gains in key customer metrics underscore the value of Iceberg Data's unique approach to data-driven business optimization.</p>",
