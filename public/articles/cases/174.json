  "Title": "Mapping In-Store 'Cold Zones': How Pathing Analysis Lifted High-Margin Sales by 22%",
  "Subtitle": "Transforming Anonymized Wi-Fi Data into Actionable Store Layout Redesigns for a National Home Improvement Retailer",
  "Business Impact": "Identified and revitalized underperforming store sections, leading to a 22% increase in sales for targeted high-margin product categories and a 15% lift in average basket size across pilot stores.",
  "Sector": "Retail",
  "What data was collected": "Anonymized in-store Wi-Fi probe requests (providing device location pings), the client's detailed store schematics (aisle layouts, product category locations), and publicly available external data including local weather forecasts, community event calendars, and competitor promotional schedules.",
  "Why this matters": "In large-format retail, the customer journey is as important as the destination. Understanding how shoppers navigate, where they hesitate, and where they never go is crucial for optimizing product placement, preventing frustration, and maximizing the value of every square foot.",
  "Implementation time": "12 to 14 weeks. This included initial data integration with the client's Wi-Fi infrastructure, development of pathing algorithms, scraping of external event data, and generating the initial layout optimization reports.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Underperformance of high-margin products due to poor visibility. 2) High customer drop-off rates from navigational frustration. 3) Inability to capitalize on traffic surges driven by external factors (e.g., a local DIY event or sudden weather change).",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "The client lacked the specialized expertise in geospatial data analysis and machine learning to convert raw Wi-Fi pings into coherent customer journey maps. Iceberg Data provided the algorithms and external data scraping infrastructure to enrich this internal data, turning a complex dataset into a clear strategic tool.",

  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "We employed a k-means clustering algorithm on anonymized Wi-Fi signal strength data (RSSI) triangulated from multiple access points to determine device coordinates within the store schematic. A sequence pattern mining algorithm was then used to identify the most frequent customer paths. External data (weather, events) was time-stamped and used as a feature layer to segment traffic patterns, revealing correlations between, for instance, rainy weekends and increased dwell time in indoor project aisles.",
  "Story": "<p>Our client, a national home improvement chain, faced a paradox common in big-box retail: their stores were always busy, but their profits weren't reflecting the high footfall. Customers would enter with a mission—buy a specific bolt, a can of paint, or a single plumbing fixture—and leave. The massive, 100,000+ square foot layouts, designed to house everything, were inadvertently creating tunnel vision. The problem was clear in their data: high traffic, but disappointingly low average basket sizes and stagnant sales in high-margin categories like power tools and kitchen fixtures.</p><p>The client's team knew they had 'cold zones' in their stores, but they couldn't quantify them or understand the 'why' behind them. They had a treasure trove of data from their in-store Wi-Fi network, which collected anonymized location pings from shoppers' devices, but it was just a chaotic collection of coordinates. They needed a way to turn this digital noise into a coherent map of the customer journey. That’s where our team at Iceberg Data came in.</p><p><strong>Our first step was to transform their raw data into visible pathways.</strong> Using their store schematics as a base map, we applied a series of geospatial algorithms to the anonymized Wi-Fi data. We weren't tracking individuals; we were tracking movement patterns in aggregate. Suddenly, we could see the highways and the ghost towns inside their stores. The results were immediate and stark. An overwhelming majority of customers followed a near-identical path: from the entrance, straight to the hardware and fasteners in 'Aisle 14', then to lumber in 'Aisle 12', and directly to the checkout. This was the 'mission-critical' path for small repairs.</p><p>Meanwhile, our analysis revealed the shocking reality of their 'cold zones.' <strong>The power tools in 'Aisle 06' and the high-end kitchen fixtures in 'Aisle 22'—two of their highest-margin categories—were practically invisible to this core traffic flow.</strong> The data showed these aisles had a traffic index below 15 (on a scale of 100), meaning less than 15% of the store's visitors ever set foot in them. Customers weren't just ignoring these products; they were structurally firewalled from them by the store's own layout.</p><p>But we didn't stop there. We enriched this internal data by scraping publicly available information. We pulled local weather forecasts and community event calendars. This allowed us to correlate in-store behavior with external triggers. For example, we discovered that after the first freeze warning of the season (scraped from weather sites), there was a 300% spike in traffic to the plumbing aisle for pipe insulation, yet the adjacent aisle with space heaters—a perfect complementary product—saw almost no corresponding lift. It was a massive missed opportunity for cross-selling.</p><p>Armed with this multi-layered insight, we provided the client with a series of concrete, data-backed recommendations. It wasn't about a full store redesign; it was about surgical, intelligent changes. We recommended they move a promotional endcap for cordless drills from the desolate 'Aisle 06' to the head of the super-highway that was 'Aisle 14'. We suggested creating 'project pods'—placing high-margin faucet displays from 'Aisle 22' near the popular seasonal gardening section, framing it as an 'Outdoor Kitchen Upgrade' project.</p><p>The client implemented these changes in a dozen pilot stores. <strong>The results over the next quarter were phenomenal.</strong> The pilot stores saw an average of a 22% sales increase in the targeted power tool and fixture categories. More importantly, the average basket size across all transactions grew by 15%, proving that by simply making the journey more intuitive and exposing customers to relevant products, they could break the 'mission-critical' shopping habit. They weren't just solving a layout problem; they were fundamentally changing how customers experienced their stores, turning frustrating searches into journeys of discovery.</p>",
