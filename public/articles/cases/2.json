    "Title": "Fleet Inventory Scraping for Demand Forecasting",
    "Subtitle": "Monitoring Vehicle Availability to Optimize Fleet Management",
    "Business Impact": "Real-time visibility into competitor and internal fleet inventories leads to more accurate demand forecasting and reduced downtime. This can help car rental providers save up to 10% in operational costs and boost fleet utilization rates significantly.",
    "Sector": "Car Rental",
    "What data was collected": "Vehicle availability status, location, vehicle category, utilization rates, and historical booking patterns from competitor websites and internal booking systems.",
    "Why this matters": "Timely and accurate information on vehicle availability is essential for aligning fleet supply with customer demand. It also mitigates the risk of over-fleet or under-fleet scenarios, optimizing resource allocation.",
    "Implementation time": "Around 6 to 8 weeks, allowing for data pipeline setup, integration with existing systems, and testing for accuracy and performance at various scale levels.",
    "Problems this solves": "1) Overestimating demand, leading to idle fleet. 2) Underestimating demand, causing customer dissatisfaction. 3) Poor visibility into which vehicle types are in high demand or lagging behind.",
    "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "An external data solutions partner brought specialized tools for large-scale scraping and an established methodology for data cleansing. Their robust infrastructure handled fluctuations in data volume and provided quick insights without burdening the in-house tech team.",
    "Input Schema": "A JSON object with location identifiers, vehicle types, and data request intervals. Example: { 'locations': ['NYC', 'LA'], 'vehicle_types': ['Sedan', 'SUV'], 'request_frequency': 'daily' }",
    "Output Schema": "A JSON object detailing current fleet availability, competitor fleet availability, and analytics on demand trends. Example: { 'location': 'NYC', 'available_fleet': { 'Sedan': 120, 'SUV': 60 }, 'competitor_availability': {...}, 'trend_analysis': {...} }",
    "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "A custom aggregator script that uses location-based matching and model classification to merge data from multiple sources, augmented by a logistic regression approach for fleet demand prediction.",
    "Story": "A car rental provider operating across multiple states struggled to align their diverse fleet with fluctuating customer demands. During peak travel seasons in bustling cities, they found themselves short on high-demand vehicles, while smaller towns saw an oversupply of underused assets. To address this, the company collaborated with a specialized data solutions firm. First, they mapped out the key data points they needed: competitor fleet counts by location, daily demand fluctuations, and historical booking records. By systematically scraping competitor websites, they established a database that updated multiple times per day, capturing changes in availability for various vehicle segments such as economy cars, SUVs, and luxury models. The data, enriched with internal booking trends, was fed into a forecasting engine. This engine used machine learning algorithms to predict upcoming demand spikes and identify overstocked locations. Within weeks of implementing the system, the company noticed immediate efficiency gains. Vehicles that used to sit idle in certain regions were reallocated to areas of growing demand. The improved alignment between supply and demand reduced operational costs by cutting unnecessary vehicle transfers and boosted revenue by keeping popular vehicle types readily available. As a result, the rental firm achieved a more consistent occupancy rate and better customer satisfaction. Outsourcing allowed them to onboard a pre-built technology stack and expert-level data teams, accelerating the entire process. Ultimately, the new inventory scraping and forecasting capability became a cornerstone in the companyâ€™s strategic approach to fleet optimization."
