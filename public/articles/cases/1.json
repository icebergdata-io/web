  "Business Impact": "This solution empowers car rental companies to dynamically adjust rental rates based on competitors’ prices, maximizing profit margins and offering customers competitive pricing. It can improve revenue growth by up to 15% while minimizing the risk of price undercutting by rivals.",
  "Sector": "Car Rental",
  "What data was collected": "Pricing data from major car rental platforms, including vehicle categories, location-based rates, seasonal fluctuations, promotional discounts, and booking durations. Data sources include competitor websites and third-party aggregator sites.",
  "Why this matters": "Accurate competitor pricing data is critical for pricing strategy. It informs revenue management teams to either match, undercut, or premium-price rentals based on perceived market demand, ensuring competitiveness and profitability.",
  "Implementation time": "Approximately 4 to 6 weeks, covering data collection and cleaning, algorithm development, integration with existing reservation systems, and thorough testing to ensure accurate real-time updates.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Overpricing leading to lost bookings. 2) Underpricing resulting in lower revenues. 3) Inconsistent pricing strategies across various locations and vehicle types.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Outsourcing gave immediate access to specialized data scraping experts and sophisticated technology stacks, reducing time-to-market. The external team’s expertise in real-time data extraction and integration ensured greater accuracy and reliability than building an in-house tool from scratch.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object containing location details (city, state), vehicle category, booking dates, and current competitor prices. Example: { 'location': 'Los Angeles', 'vehicle_type': 'SUV', 'date_range': '2025-03-01 to 2025-03-05', 'competitor_prices': [{...}] }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON object with recommended rental price suggestions, confidence scores, and supporting competitor data. Example: { 'recommended_price': 55.99, 'confidence_score': 0.92, 'competitor_data': [{...}] }",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "A combination of web scraping scripts, pattern matching for identifying vehicle categories, and a dynamic pricing algorithm powered by a gradient-boosted regression model that factors in competitor prices, historical rental data, and seasonal trends.",
