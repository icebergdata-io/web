  "Title": "Mitigating Spoilage by 18% Through Predictive Port Congestion & Carrier Reliability Analysis",
  "Subtitle": "Using Real-Time Logistics Data to Proactively Reroute Perishable Goods Shipments",
  "Business Impact": "Reduced product spoilage by 18%, cut unexpected demurrage and detention fees by over 30%, and improved on-time, in-full (OTIF) delivery rates by 22% within nine months.",
  "Sector": "Logistics & Cold Chain Management",
  "What data was collected": "Public port authority terminal schedules and wait-time dashboards, real-time Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data, historical weather patterns for major shipping lanes, carrier performance metrics scraped from logistics industry forums, and public customs brokerage reports on clearance times.",
  "Why this matters": "For companies shipping perishable or time-sensitive goods, a reactive supply chain is a recipe for financial loss. Predictive insights allow for proactive rerouting and carrier selection, turning a major operational risk into a competitive advantage by ensuring product integrity and delivery reliability.",
  "Implementation time": "12 to 14 weeks, which included developing scrapers for dozens of international port authority sites, creating a carrier reliability scoring model, and integrating the data stream into the client's existing TMS dashboard.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) High spoilage rates for temperature-sensitive cargo due to unforeseen transit delays. 2) Crippling demurrage and detention fees caused by port congestion. 3) Lack of objective, real-time data on third-party logistics (3PL) carrier reliability beyond contractual SLAs.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Scraping data from a multitude of global port authority websites, each with a different structure and language, requires robust, adaptable technology. An external partner like Iceberg Data specializes in managing this complexity, handling anti-scraping measures, and normalizing disparate data formats into a single, clean API feed.",

  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Vessel AIS tracking data is matched to public container manifests using the ship's unique IMO number. This is then correlated with the destination port's public berthing schedule and historical wait-time data to predict congestion. Carrier reliability is calculated by scraping public reviews and on-time performance data from logistics portals, creating a weighted score that is tied to the carrier's official Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC).",
  "Story": "<p>Our client, a major distributor of specialty pharmaceuticals, faced a multimillion-dollar problem. Their core products were life-saving medicines that required strict, uninterrupted refrigeration from the factory to the hospital. Their global supply chain, however, was a black box. They relied on their freight forwarders' estimates, but time and again, shipments would get stuck for weeks at congested ports like Los Angeles or Rotterdam. Each day of delay was a gamble against the container's generator fuel and the product's stability. They came to us after losing a $2 million shipment that spoiled on the tarmac, a loss that was not just financial but also impacted patient care.</p><p><strong>The core challenge was a lack of predictive visibility.</strong> They knew a shipment was delayed only when it was already too late. Their existing systems could track a ship on the water, but they couldn't predict the chaos waiting for it at the destination port. They needed to see the future, not just the present. Our team at Iceberg Data proposed a market intelligence solution focused on external, public data sources to build a predictive risk model for their key shipping lanes.</p><p>First, we deployed a fleet of custom web scrapers targeting the public-facing websites and data portals of the world's top 50 busiest ports. This wasn't simple; these sites were in a dozen different languages and had wildly different data structures. Our scrapers extracted crucial metrics: current vessel queues, average berth wait times, and terminal productivity statistics. This gave us a real-time snapshot of congestion at each critical node in their network.</p><p>Next, we integrated real-time Automatic Identification System (AIS) data to track the physical location and speed of every vessel carrying their containers. By matching a vessel's IMO number from the AIS feed with the client's shipping manifests, we knew exactly which ship was carrying which precious cargo. But this was still just real-time tracking. <strong>The real intelligence came from layering predictive data on top.</strong> We scraped historical weather data for their primary shipping lanes, identifying seasonal risks like typhoon seasons in the Pacific or winter storms in the North Atlantic that historically led to delays.</p><p>The final, crucial piece was carrier reliability. Our client worked with multiple ocean freight carriers, but their performance data was anecdotal. To solve this, we scraped logistics industry forums and carrier review portals to build a proprietary <strong>Carrier Reliability Index</strong>. By analyzing thousands of public posts about on-time performance, communication, and issue resolution, we assigned a dynamic reliability score to each carrier. This allowed the client to see, for the first time, an objective, data-driven comparison of their logistics partners.</p><p>We funneled all this disparate data—port congestion, vessel locations, weather risks, and carrier scores—into a unified dashboard. Now, before a shipment even left the factory, the logistics team could run a 'Route Risk Assessment.' As shown in our example JSON, they could input a container's planned route, and our system would output a comprehensive risk analysis. It would flag a high-congestion port like 'USLAX' and, as seen in the recommendation, proactively suggest rerouting to a less-congested nearby port like 'USLGB,' quantifying the potential time saved.</p><p>The results were transformative. Within nine months, our client had reduced spoilage-related losses by a staggering 18%. By proactively rerouting shipments away from brewing logjams, they slashed their demurrage and detention fees by over 30%. Their on-time, in-full delivery rate—a critical metric in the pharmaceutical world—jumped by 22%. They were no longer at the mercy of the supply chain; they were actively shaping it, using market intelligence to turn a massive operational vulnerability into a powerful competitive edge.",
