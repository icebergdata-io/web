  "Title": "B2B Lead Mining from Public Webinar and Workshop Listings",
  "Subtitle": "Extracting Attendee Information to Target Niche Leads",
  "Business Impact": "By identifying engaged individuals who publicly register for online industry workshops, businesses can tailor outreach, lifting conversion rates by up to 20%.",
  "Sector": "Lead Generation",
  "What data was collected": "Public attendee lists posted on event platforms, event registration pages, speaker announcements, and social media mentions of participants confirming attendance.",
  "Why this matters": "Attendees of niche workshops or webinars are often ripe prospects; capturing their public data quickly ensures timely follow-up when their interest is highest.",
  "Implementation time": "3 to 5 weeks, including event site scraping setup, LinkedIn cross-referencing to confirm roles, and compliance checks for publicly shared personal details.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Reliance on generic lead databases without topic alignment. 2) High resource drain trying to manually track workshop participants. 3) Missing out on fresh leads if attendee lists are not consistently monitored.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Expert scrapers maintain specialized event-crawling tools and best practices for gleaning participant data ethically, respecting site rules and privacy boundaries.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object with event URLs, date ranges, and desired attendee roles or industries. Example: { 'event_pages': ['https://workshopsite.com'], 'time_window': 'May 2025', 'target_roles': ['CTO', 'Data Scientist'] }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON array of attendee leads, each with name, role, company, and contact detail if publicly available. Example: [ { 'name': 'Jane Doe', 'role': 'CTO', 'company': 'TechCorp', 'linkedin': '...' }, ... ]",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Public participant rosters are cross-referenced with LinkedIn or other open directories to confirm job titles, ensuring the leads truly match the target profile.",
  "Story": "A specialized software consultancy sought to penetrate the AI healthcare market but found conventional lead lists too broad. They hired a web scraping outfit to track public workshop attendee lists for AI in healthcare events. The scrapers monitored event registration pages, pull speaker rosters, and even watched social media announcements where participants publicly tagged themselves. Within weeks, the consultancy gained a curated feed of professionals who were actively seeking knowledge on AI-driven diagnostics—a prime indicator of readiness for a commercial solution. Cross-checking LinkedIn profiles confirmed that many were CTOs or senior data scientists at midsized hospital networks. This real-time approach gave the consultancy’s sales team a fresh pipeline of potential clients, which they contacted shortly after each workshop ended. Because all data was publicly visible, they avoided any privacy red flags and adhered to event site policies. Ultimately, timing proved everything—several leads were impressed by how quickly the consultancy followed up, translating to deeper product demos and a stronger conversion rate. By outsourcing the scraping, the firm saved hundreds of hours and ensured steady updates on newly registered attendees, fueling a sustainable growth strategy within the AI healthcare niche.",
