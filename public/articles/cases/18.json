    "Title": "Ratings Aggregation from Public OTA Listings",
    "Subtitle": "Centralizing Guest Feedback to Enhance Hotel Offerings",
    "Business Impact": "Collecting property ratings from multiple public OTA platforms (like Booking.com and Expedia) enables hotels to address repeating issues faster, improving guest satisfaction by over 10%.",
    "Sector": "Hotels",
    "What data was collected": "Public star ratings, textual reviews, amenity mentions, location commentary, and competitor properties’ rating breakdowns displayed on OTAs’ public pages.",
    "Why this matters": "Each OTA might have slightly different rating systems, and guests often post distinct reviews on different sites. A unified, web-scraped view reveals property strengths and weaknesses at scale.",
    "Implementation time": "4 to 6 weeks, focusing on OTA data scraping pipelines, data normalization, and generating a consolidated dashboard.",
    "Problems this solves": "1) Duplicate manual effort to check multiple OTA dashboards. 2) Missed trends when reviews are scattered across different websites. 3) Limited insight into how competitor ratings stack up publicly.",
    "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Professional scrapers have established frameworks and back-end knowledge of OTA sites, ensuring continuous data capture without risking account blocking or incomplete results.",
    "Input Schema": "A JSON object specifying OTA property URLs, competitor listings, and the time window for reviews. Example: { 'property_listings': ['urlA', 'urlB'], 'competitor_listings': ['urlC'], 'review_window': '90 days' }",
    "Output Schema": "A JSON object summarizing aggregated ratings, top positive/negative themes, and comparison with competitor properties. Example: { 'overall_rating': 4.3, 'themes': { 'positive': [...], 'negative': [...] }, 'competitor_comparison': [...] }",
    "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Property IDs matched with OTA listings via direct URL or known IDs. Reviews are cleansed, normalized, and sorted into topics or sentiment clusters for side-by-side comparisons.",
    "Story": "A boutique hotel wanted a comprehensive snapshot of its performance across multiple OTAs, from Booking.com to Expedia. Although it had separate management logins for each platform, managers found it cumbersome to track new comments or rating changes every day. By partnering with a web scraping company, the hotel gained a single feed of updated OTA reviews aggregated at the end of each day. The scraper captured numerical ratings as well as guest comments about location convenience, staff friendliness, or room quality—data that was fully visible on the public booking pages. Simultaneously, competitor listings were monitored so the hotel could compare star averages and trending topics. Over a few weeks, managers uncovered consistent praise for the hotel’s cozy design but also repeated complaints about slow Wi-Fi. Noticing that a key competitor had recently upgraded internet services—and posted it prominently in its OTA listing—the boutique hotel followed suit, marketing a new high-speed Wi-Fi rollout. This proactive approach caused guest satisfaction metrics to climb on subsequent daily scrapes. Without automated public scraping, staff might have overlooked how vital Wi-Fi was to modern travelers or how significantly competitor improvements influenced booking decisions. Ultimately, centralizing these reviews reshaped the hotel’s operational priorities, improved star averages, and boosted overall occupancy rates."
