  "Title": "Decoding Shadow Prices: Gaining a 15% Margin Uplift by Deconstructing Competitor Product Bundles",
  "Subtitle": "Using web scraping and NLP to calculate the 'true' component price within competitor kits and promotions for strategic counter-offers.",
  "Business Impact": "Achieved a 15% average margin improvement on key product lines and increased sales conversion by 8% by strategically unbundling or re-bundling offers to counter competitor tactics.",
  "Sector": "E-commerce",
  "What data was collected": "Competitor product pages for bundled/kitted items, individual component product pages (SKUs, prices, stock status), promotional banner text, and historical pricing data for all related items.",
  "Why this matters": "Competitors obscure true item prices within bundles, making direct price comparisons impossible. Deconstructing these bundles reveals their underlying pricing strategy, allowing for more precise and competitive counter-offers.",
  "Implementation time": "6 to 8 weeks, including initial scraper development for target sites, building the bundle decomposition logic, and creating a pricing alert dashboard.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Inability to accurately price-match bundled products. 2) Losing sales to seemingly better 'value' bundles from competitors. 3) Margin erosion from unnecessarily deep discounts on individual items to compete with kits.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Scraping complex e-commerce sites with dynamic content and anti-bot measures is challenging. An expert partner manages proxy rotation, handles JavaScript rendering, and develops the custom NLP logic needed to identify and link component SKUs within a bundle description.",

  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Our system uses a multi-stage algorithm. First, it scrapes the bundle page, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify component product names and model numbers from the description text. Second, it performs an automated search on the competitor's site for each identified component to locate its individual product page and scrape its standalone price and SKU. Finally, it calculates the bundle's total standalone value and determines the effective, non-proportional discount applied to each component, revealing the competitor's true promotional strategy.",
  "Story": "<p>Our client, a thriving e-commerce retailer in consumer electronics, came to us with a frustrating and costly problem. They were losing ground in the highly lucrative 'content creator' market to a larger, more aggressive competitor. The issue wasn't product quality or service; it was pricing, but not in a way their existing tools could handle. Their main rival was offering a 'Pro Vlogger Kit' at a price that seemed to defy logic. Our client’s automated price-matching software, which tracked the price of their standalone camera, was useless. How do you price-match a single camera against a three-piece kit? They were caught in a bind: either do nothing and lose sales, or blindly slash the price of their camera, destroying their margins without even knowing if it was the right move.</p><p>This is a classic case of what we call <strong>'shadow pricing'</strong>. Competitors use bundles to obscure the true price of individual items, making direct comparisons impossible and rendering standard competitive intelligence tools obsolete. They were leveraging a high-demand camera to create a value perception that was difficult to counter. Our client needed to see behind the curtain.</p><p>Our team at Iceberg Data proposed a custom intelligence solution we called the 'Bundle Deconstructor'. We knew that just scraping the bundle's price of $799.99 was pointless. The real intelligence lay in understanding its composition. We deployed a sophisticated web scraper targeting the competitor’s product page for the 'Pro Vlogger Kit'. This scraper was designed not just to pull prices, but to read and understand content. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), our system parsed the product description, identifying the names and, crucially, the specific model numbers of the three items in the kit: a 'ProShot X5 Camera', a 'SoundWave Pro7 Shotgun Mic', and a 'GlowUp Mini LED Panel'.</p><p>This was only the first step. The real magic happened next. Armed with these specific model numbers, our scraping engine automatically performed a series of targeted searches across the competitor's entire website. It located the individual product pages for the camera, the microphone, and the light panel. From these pages, it extracted the most important data point: the standalone, sold-separately price for each component. This gave us the ground truth we needed for our analysis.</p><p>The results, as visualized in our dashboard, were the 'aha!' moment for our client. The data, perfectly matching our output JSON example, revealed the competitor's precise strategy. The standalone prices were $649.99 for the camera, $149.99 for the microphone, and $59.99 for the light. The total value if bought separately was $859.97. The bundle price of $799.99 represented a total discount of about $60. But the critical insight was in the <strong>distribution of that discount</strong>. Our analysis calculated that the competitor had applied a massive $40 discount to the camera, a respectable $20 discount to the microphone, and had actually charged a fraction of a cent *over* the standalone price for the light to reach a round bundle price. </p><p>The competitor wasn't just offering a simple package deal; they were using the popular camera as a strategic loss leader to drive sales and move higher-margin accessories. They knew customers were price-shopping for the camera, so they made that component look like an unbeatable deal within the bundle. Armed with this granular intelligence, our client didn't just blindly cut their camera price. They executed a much smarter, surgical counter-move. They created their own vlogger bundle, slightly undercutting the competitor's camera price, but they swapped the microphone for a different, superior model that they sourced with a better profit margin. They could now market their bundle not just on price, but on superior audio quality—a key feature for vloggers. The result was a resounding success. They stopped the sales bleed almost immediately, increased their conversion rate in the category by 8%, and, most importantly, improved their profit margin on these bundled sales by 15% because they weren't giving away value where it wasn't needed. They transformed from playing defense to playing offense, all powered by a deeper understanding of their competitor's strategy.",
