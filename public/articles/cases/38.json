  "Title": "Retail Event Partnerships via Public Community Calendar Scraping",
  "Subtitle": "Increasing Store Traffic by Aligning with Local Gatherings",
  "Business Impact": "Collaborating with local events—discovered through publicly posted calendars—can lift store visits by 20%, especially if integrated with time-limited, relevant promotions.",
  "Sector": "Retail",
  "What data was collected": "Publicly available event listings from city tourism websites, community newsletters, competitor sponsorship notices, and social media event invites indicating expected attendance.",
  "Why this matters": "Local events generate foot traffic that retailers can capture if they coordinate promotions and product displays aligned with the event’s theme and timing.",
  "Implementation time": "4 to 6 weeks, including scraping official municipal or community sites, analyzing competitor sponsorship mentions, and building an internal scheduling tool for event-based promotions.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Missing out on surges in potential customers during fairs, sports matches, or festivals. 2) Lack of data on competitor strategies for event collaborations. 3) Minimal marketing alignment with local community interests.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "External scrapers efficiently collect event info from multiple public sources, providing retailers with a curated event feed they can act on without manual searching.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object with event calendar URLs, relevant categories (sports, culture), date filters, and competitor brand mentions. Example: { 'calendar_links': ['CityGov.com/events'], 'categories': ['sports', 'fair'], 'date_range': 'Summer 2025', 'competitor_brands': ['StoreX'] }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON object detailing upcoming events, estimated attendance, competitor ties, and suggested promotions. Example: { 'event': 'County Fair', 'expected_attendance': 5000, 'competitor_involvement': true, 'promotion_ideas': [...] }",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Event data is filtered by date and category. Competitor mentions or sponsorship announcements on the same sites or social pages are flagged for strategic comparisons.",
  "Story": "<p>A local hardware chain faced a perplexing challenge: random spikes in weekend store traffic with no discernible cause.
