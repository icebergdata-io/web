  "Story": "A consumer electronics brand found that some of its flagship headphones barely appeared on the first page of marketplace searches, lagging behind lesser-known brands with thousands of reviews. To tackle the issue, the brand brought in a web scraping solution that systematically scanned the marketplace’s public search result pages for relevant headphone keywords. The scrapers pulled competitor listings, analyzing everything from bullet-point content to the number of product images, as well as star ratings and review volumes. Patterns emerged—top-ranked listings used keywords like “noise-canceling” or “wireless Bluetooth 5.0” in the product title, displayed at least five images, and maintained a 4.5-star average with hundreds of reviews. Adopting these findings, the brand updated its listing titles to include essential keywords, improved product photos, and encouraged satisfied customers to leave reviews through social channels. Within weeks, the brand’s headphone listing climbed into the top 10 search results, driving a noticeable surge in traffic and conversions. By outsourcing the scraping piece, the team gained daily ranking updates and competitor insights they could quickly act on. The result: a far more visible digital shelf presence, higher sales, and a renewed focus on listing optimization as a core e-commerce strategy.",
