  "Title": "Digital Shelf Optimization via Public Marketplace Scraping",
  "Subtitle": "Tracking Keyword Rankings and Competitor Products to Boost Visibility",
  "Business Impact": "Appearing in top search positions on major marketplaces can increase sales by up to 25%. Scraping public product listings and search result pages reveals how to improve ranking factors.",
  "Sector": "Ecommerce",
  "What data was collected": "Marketplace search results pages, competitor product titles, listing images, bullet points, user question threads, and rating counts—publicly visible on sites like Amazon or Walmart.",
  "Why this matters": "Even small changes in ranking position can drastically affect an item’s visibility. Detailed competitor listing data guides optimal keyword usage, product imagery, and promotional strategies.",
  "Implementation time": "6 to 8 weeks, entailing marketplace scraping scripts, a ranking analysis engine, and recommended listing adjustments based on publicly gleaned best practices.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Uncertainty about how different keywords affect rank. 2) Blind spots regarding competitor listing tactics. 3) Difficulty assessing how rating counts or images influence search placement.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Professional scraping services specialize in capturing daily or weekly search result snapshots without losing data or violating marketplace guidelines, preserving consistent insights.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object specifying marketplace, target keywords, and competitor SKUs. Example: { 'marketplace': 'Amazon', 'keywords': ['wireless earbuds'], 'competitor_skus': ['B07XYZ', 'B08ABC'] }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON object highlighting each product’s rank, listing attributes, competitor comparisons, and next-step recommendations. Example: { 'sku': 'B07XYZ', 'rank_position': 5, 'attributes': {...}, 'recommendations': [{...}] }",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Keyword-based pattern recognition for product titles and bullet points. The engine correlates these with ranking changes, along with rating counts to measure listing effectiveness.",
  "Story": "A consumer electronics brand found that some of its flagship headphones barely appeared on the first page of marketplace searches, lagging behind lesser-known brands with thousands of reviews. To tackle the issue, the brand brought in a web scraping solution that systematically scanned the marketplace’s public search result pages for relevant headphone keywords. The scrapers pulled competitor listings, analyzing everything from bullet-point content to the number of product images, as well as star ratings and review volumes. Patterns emerged—top-ranked listings used keywords like “noise-canceling” or “wireless Bluetooth 5.0” in the product title, displayed at least five images, and maintained a 4.5-star average with hundreds of reviews. Adopting these findings, the brand updated its listing titles to include essential keywords, improved product photos, and encouraged satisfied customers to leave reviews through social channels. Within weeks, the brand’s headphone listing climbed into the top 10 search results, driving a noticeable surge in traffic and conversions. By outsourcing the scraping piece, the team gained daily ranking updates and competitor insights they could quickly act on. The result: a far more visible digital shelf presence, higher sales, and a renewed focus on listing optimization as a core e-commerce strategy.",
