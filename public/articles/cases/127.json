  "Title": "Scaling Authenticity: Identifying Untapped Micro-Influencers for a 40% Lower CPA",
  "Subtitle": "Using Web Scraping to Uncover and Vet Genuine Brand Advocates from Organic Social Media Mentions in the Sustainable Fashion Niche",
  "Business Impact": "Our data intelligence solution identified over 500 high-potential micro-influencers who were already organic brand fans, leading to a 300% increase in authentic user-generated content and a 40% reduction in customer acquisition cost (CPA) compared to the client's traditional paid ad campaigns.",
  "Sector": "E-commerce",
  "What data was collected": "Public user posts from Instagram and TikTok containing brand tags, product mentions, or specific campaign hashtags. We also collected user profile data (follower count, bio), post engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares), and comment text for sentiment analysis.",
  "Why this matters": "In saturated markets like sustainable fashion, authenticity is paramount. Identifying influencers who are already genuine fans creates more trustworthy marketing, fosters a loyal community, and delivers a significantly higher ROI than partnering with generic, high-cost macro-influencers who lack a real connection to the brand's values.",
  "Implementation time": "6 to 8 weeks for initial scraping setup, data enrichment, building the scoring model, and delivering the first actionable list of vetted brand advocates.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) High cost and low authenticity of traditional influencer marketing. 2) The immense manual effort required to find and vet genuine micro-influencers at scale. 3) Inability to quantify the impact of organic brand mentions and turn them into a strategic asset.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "A specialized partner like Iceberg Data navigates the complexities of scraping dynamic social media platforms at scale without interruption. Our established infrastructure for data processing and Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows for immediate analysis of post sentiment and user potential, a capability that would take months or years for an in-house team to develop.",

  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Our process begins by scraping public social media data for posts matching the client's target keywords and tags. We then use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of the post's caption and its associated comments. A proprietary 'Advocate Potential Score' is then calculated for each user by weighting their follower count, their profile-wide average engagement rate, the specific engagement on the brand-mention post, and the overall sentiment score. This creates a ranked list of the most promising and authentic potential partners.",
  "Story": "<p>Our client, a promising direct-to-consumer brand in the sustainable fashion space, faced a common but critical challenge. Their growth was plateauing. While their products were exceptional and their mission resonated with conscious consumers, their marketing felt stuck. They had dabbled in traditional influencer marketing, paying large sums to macro-influencers, but the results were disappointing. The content felt staged, engagement was shallow, and the customer acquisition cost (CPA) was unsustainably high. They knew their most powerful advocates were real customers, but they had no scalable way to find them. <strong>Their marketing director told us, 'We believe there are hundreds of micro-influencers out there who genuinely love our brand, but finding them feels like searching for needles in a global haystack.'</strong></p><p>That's where our team at Iceberg Data came in. We proposed a shift in strategy: instead of 'buying' influence, we would 'discover' it. The goal was to systematically identify, vet, and rank individuals who were already posting organically about the client’s products. These were the true brand advocates, and their endorsements would carry the weight of authenticity that no paid partnership ever could.</p><p>Our first step was to deploy a targeted web scraping and data collection strategy across Instagram and TikTok. We configured our systems to monitor a specific set of keywords, including the client's brand handle ('@SustainableStyleCo'), their primary hashtags, and related terms within their niche. We focused specifically on users with follower counts between 1,000 and 50,000—the 'micro-influencer' sweet spot where engagement is typically highest and communities are most tightly-knit. The initial data harvest was massive, pulling in tens of thousands of public posts over a few weeks.</p><p>Simply finding mentions wasn't enough. The real value was in the analysis. We processed this raw data through our proprietary pipeline. <strong>First, we calculated the engagement rate for each user's specific brand-mention post and compared it to their profile-wide average.</strong> A spike in engagement on a post featuring our client's product was a strong positive signal. Next, our Natural Language Processing (NLP) models analyzed the sentiment of the post's caption and, crucially, the comments left by their followers. We filtered out neutral or negative mentions and prioritized posts with overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic language.</p><p>The final piece of the puzzle was creating the <strong>'Advocate Potential Score.'</strong> This composite metric, visible in our output JSON, combined all our data points: follower count, average engagement, post-specific engagement, and sentiment score. This gave the client a simple, ranked list of the highest-potential partners to reach out to. Instead of a cold pitch, their outreach was warm and personal: 'We saw your amazing post about our jacket and we'd love to officially partner with you.' This approach was a game-changer.</p><p>Within the first two months, the client had a vetted list of over 500 authentic micro-influencers. They initiated a formal brand ambassador program, offering product gifts and small commissions instead of large upfront fees. The results were staggering. The program generated over 1,000 pieces of high-quality, authentic user-generated content (UGC)—a 300% increase from their previous efforts. Most importantly, the CPA from this channel was <strong>40% lower</strong> than their paid social media campaigns. We had not only solved their 'haystack' problem but had also provided them with a sustainable, scalable engine for authentic community-led growth.</p>",
