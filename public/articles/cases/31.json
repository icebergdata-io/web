    "Title": "Marketing Communications Analysis by Scraping Public Ad Campaigns",
    "Subtitle": "Observing Competitor Ads in Real Time to Optimize Your Messaging",
    "Business Impact": "Refining ad content based on real-time competitor moves and consumer responses can increase ROI by 20%. Public ad scraping reveals when and how rivals pivot strategies.",
    "Sector": "Market Analytics",
    "What data was collected": "Competitor social media ads, ad copy from search engine results, banner creatives on public websites, and user engagement metrics (likes, shares) visible on social platforms.",
    "Why this matters": "Marketers often waste budget if they ignore competitor messaging shifts. Quick detection of new campaigns helps refine brand positioning and craft timely counter-ads.",
    "Implementation time": "8 to 12 weeks, focusing on social media ad library scraping, search ad monitoring, and consumer sentiment analysis on publicly displayed engagement stats.",
    "Problems this solves": "1) Blindly running ads without awareness of competitor's angle. 2) Slow adaptation to new discount-driven or influencer-led campaigns. 3) Missing signals that user sentiment is skewing in competitor’s favor.",
    "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Web scraping specialists can access and compile publicly visible ad data from multiple platforms efficiently, staying compliant with each site’s terms and frequent UI changes.",
    "Input Schema": "A JSON object indicating competitor brand handles, ad library URLs, and engagement metrics to track. Example: { 'competitor_handles': ['BrandAOfficial'], 'ad_library_links': ['fb.com/ads/library/BrandA'], 'metrics': ['likes', 'shares'] }",
    "Output Schema": "A JSON object summarizing each competitor’s ad volume, top themes, engagement rates, and recommended counter-strategies. Example: { 'competitor': 'BrandA', 'ad_count': 10, 'dominant_theme': 'Holiday Sale', 'engagement': {...}, 'recommendations': [...] }",
    "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Brand references and campaign hashtags are identified in publicly displayed ads. Engagement stats (likes, shares) are aggregated and cross-linked to ad copy for performance analysis.",
    "Story": "A mid-sized cosmetics company was consistently outbid by bigger rivals on social media ad placements. Hoping to make its budget stretch further, the firm engaged a web scraping agency to continuously watch competitors’ public ads and glean insights from user interactions. The scrapers hit official Facebook Ad Library pages, scanning all newly published promotional campaigns from major cosmetic brands. They also captured engagement metrics (like comment volumes) to see which competitor promotions sparked real interest. Through these daily data feeds, the cosmetics firm noted that Competitor X had switched to a ‘clean beauty’ narrative, flooding Instagram with influencer tie-ins that garnered high shares. Recognizing a potential brand positioning gap, the firm adjusted its next wave of ads to emphasize natural ingredients and highlight a new organic certification. Additionally, they scheduled new promotions to coincide with competitor silence on weekends, capturing users’ attention at a fraction of the cost. Offloading the scraping task allowed the marketing team to pivot quickly, refining content and timing in near real-time. This shift yielded a higher click-through rate, improved brand perception, and a more efficient ad budget overall—directly attributable to the constantly updated competitor intel gleaned from public ad spaces."
