  "Title": "Housekeeping Performance via Public Review Scraping",
  "Subtitle": "Collecting Comments on Cleanliness to Streamline Hotel Room Turnover",
  "Business Impact": "Analyzing guest complaints and praise about cleanliness—posted on public review sites—helps hotels optimize housekeeping schedules, reduce negative feedback, and save up to 15% in operational costs.",
  "Sector": "Hotels",
  "What data was collected": "Public guest reviews regarding room cleanliness, housekeeping promptness, average star ratings, and competitor housekeeping metrics gleaned from aggregator review summaries.",
  "Why this matters": "Clean rooms are fundamental to guest satisfaction. Observing patterns in competitor housekeeping complaints and star ratings can guide improvements, lowering negative feedback and increasing repeat bookings.",
  "Implementation time": "8 to 12 weeks, including scraping multiple review platforms, sentiment analysis, and generating housekeeping recommendations.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Delayed identification of housekeeping failures. 2) Overlooking competitor best practices in cleanliness. 3) Strained labor costs due to inefficient cleaning assignments.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "A specialized web scraping company maintains stable crawlers for major travel review sites, ensuring hotels receive continuous, policy-compliant updates on cleanliness-related feedback.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object specifying review platforms, competitor property IDs, and relevant cleanliness keywords. Example: { 'review_sources': ['TripAdvisor', 'Booking.com'], 'competitor_hotels': [123, 456], 'keywords': ['dirty', 'cleanliness', 'housekeeping'] }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON object detailing common cleanliness complaints, competitor rating comparisons, and schedule optimization suggestions. Example: { 'hotel_id': 202, 'common_feedback': ['room not ready', 'stained sheets'], 'rating_comparison': {...}, 'recommended_shifts': [...] }",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Text analysis identifies cleanliness-related terms and star rating contexts. Competitor reviews are matched by property ID, enabling direct rating comparisons of housekeeping performance.",
  "Story": "A large downtown hotel chain noticed fluctuating guest feedback on cleanliness. While internal logs showed housekeeping schedules were consistent, online reviews told a different story. Determined to address this, the hotel hired a web scraping provider to systematically gather relevant housekeeping complaints and praises from review sites. The scraper targeted words like ‘clean,’ ‘dirty,’ or ‘room not ready’ within a set radius of each hotel property ID. Competitor ratings were also collected to see how well other brands managed housekeeping. Within weeks, the aggregated data revealed that guests arriving early often complained about unclean rooms, suggesting a mismatch between check-out times and housekeeping shifts. Meanwhile, reviews for competing hotels praised rapid turnover and flexible cleaning schedules. Based on these findings, the hotel chain adjusted staff shifts to ensure more rooms were ready for early arrivals, cutting down negative remarks. Additionally, managers standardized checklists for housekeeping teams that included the most frequently cited cleaning issues. Outsourcing the scraping portion meant that all data was pulled automatically and ethically from public sources, leaving the hotel free to act on insights rather than worry about scraping complexities. Over time, improved housekeeping schedules translated into fewer negative cleanliness reviews, elevating the hotel’s reputation online and ultimately boosting bookings.",
