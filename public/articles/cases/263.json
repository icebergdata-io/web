  "Title": "Capturing Market Share in Consumer Electronics with Stock-Aware Dynamic Promotions",
  "Subtitle": "Leveraging Real-Time Competitor Inventory Data to Optimize Sales Events and Maximize Margins",
  "Business Impact": "Implemented a stock-aware promotional strategy that increased conversion rates on targeted products by 18% and grew market share in key categories by 5% within a single quarter.",
  "Sector": "Retail",
  "What data was collected": "High-frequency scraping of competitor product pages to capture price, product SKUs, promotional banner text, shipping estimates, and, most critically, inventory indicators such as 'In Stock', 'Low Stock', 'Only X left', and 'Out of Stock'.",
  "Why this matters": "Traditional dynamic pricing is reactive, often leading to margin-eroding price wars. A stock-aware strategy is proactive; it allows a retailer to capitalize on a competitor's operational weakness (a stockout) by launching a targeted promotion to capture high-intent buyers who cannot purchase elsewhere.",
  "Implementation time": "6 to 8 weeks, which included developing robust scrapers for multiple complex e-commerce sites, creating a data normalization pipeline, and integrating the real-time data feed via API into the client's promotional engine.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Reactive price-matching that erodes profit margins. 2) Missed sales opportunities when competitors have inventory issues. 3) Inefficient promotion timing that fails to capitalize on shifts in market supply.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Outsourcing to Iceberg Data provided access to a scalable, resilient infrastructure capable of handling anti-bot measures, complex JavaScript rendering, and proxy management. This allowed the client to receive clean, reliable, real-time data without diverting their internal engineering resources from core business functions.",

  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Our system uses a multi-faceted matching algorithm. Initially, it matches products based on universal identifiers like UPCs or Manufacturer Part Numbers (MPNs) when available. For retailers without these public identifiers, we employ a fuzzy matching model that combines product title text similarity (using TF-IDF and Levenshtein distance), image recognition (using perceptual hashing), and key specification attributes (e.g., screen size, storage capacity) to achieve over 98% matching accuracy.",
  "Story": "<p>Our client, a prominent regional consumer electronics retailer, was caught in a classic race to the bottom. Their dynamic pricing strategy was entirely defensive; their system would scrape competitor prices and automatically match the lowest price, relentlessly chipping away at their own margins. They were winning on price but losing the war on profitability. Their marketing team had a hunch that there were smarter ways to compete, noticing sporadic, unexplained sales spikes for certain high-value items. They suspected these spikes correlated with inventory shortages at major national competitors, but they had no data to prove it or act on it systematically.</p><p>This is where our team at Iceberg Data came in. We proposed a radical shift in strategy: from defensive price-matching to <strong>offensive, opportunity-based promotions</strong>. The core hypothesis was that a competitor's 'Out of Stock' status on a popular product is a powerful, temporary market advantage. A customer looking for a specific item like the 'Sony 55 Inch Bravia XR TV' is a high-intent buyer. If their preferred retailer is out of stock, their loyalty is immediately up for grabs. We pitched a solution to provide the real-time data needed to seize these fleeting moments.</p><p>Our task was to build a high-frequency web scraping engine targeting their three largest national competitors. The challenge went beyond simple price extraction. We needed to reliably parse and normalize inventory signalsâ€”subtle text variations like 'Out of Stock', 'Unavailable Online', 'Low Stock', or 'Only 2 Left!'. These signals were often loaded dynamically with JavaScript, requiring a sophisticated scraping infrastructure that could render pages like a real user to capture the true availability status.</p><p>Within six weeks, we delivered a real-time data feed directly to their promotional engine via API. The client's team then configured a new set of business rules. For example, for the 'SNY-TV-55X90L', they set up a trigger: <strong>IF a Tier-1 competitor's `stock_status` changes to 'Out of Stock', THEN automatically launch 'PROMOTION_A'</strong>. 'PROMOTION_A' wasn't a price drop; instead, it was a value-add offer like free white-glove delivery and a prominent 'Guaranteed In Stock & Ships Today!' banner on their homepage and product page. Simultaneously, the rule would increase their paid search ad spend for that specific TV model's keywords.</p><p>The first major test came during a pre-holiday sales rush. At 2:30 PM on a Friday, our system fired an alert, just like the one in our `Example_Output_JSON`. A major competitor had just sold out of the Sony TV. The client's automated system kicked in instantly. Their website's homepage banner changed, and targeted ads went live. They didn't have to lower their price of $1199.99 at all. They simply highlighted what their competitors couldn't offer: availability.</p><p>The results were staggering. Over that weekend, their sales for that TV model increased by 300% compared to the previous weekend. The conversion rate for visitors who landed on that product page shot up by 18%. They captured an entire segment of frustrated, ready-to-buy customers. By the time their competitor was back in stock on Tuesday, our client had already sold through nearly their entire inventory for that model, all while preserving their full margin. This single event proved the value of proactive, data-driven promotions. Over the next quarter, applying this stock-aware strategy to their top 50 SKUs allowed them to strategically capture demand, boosting overall market share by 5% in those categories and fundamentally transforming their approach from reactive discounting to profitable, intelligent marketing.</p>",
