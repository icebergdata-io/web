  "Title": "Unbundling Competitor Package Deals: A Data-Driven Strategy to Boost Ancillary Revenue by 18%",
  "Subtitle": "Leveraging Web Scraping to Decode Competitor Bundled Offers and Inform Dynamic Ancillary Pricing",
  "Business Impact": "By dissecting competitor package deals and understanding the perceived value of each component, our client optimized their own ancillary pricing, leading to an 18% increase in ancillary revenue per booking and a 5% lift in direct bookings.",
  "Sector": "Hotels",
  "What data was collected": "Competitor direct booking websites and OTA listings for package deals, including package names, total prices, room types, stay dates, and detailed descriptions of included amenities (e.g., 'spa credit,' 'valet parking,' 'free breakfast'). We also collected standalone room prices for the same dates and public pricing for individual ancillary services (e.g., parking rates, restaurant menus).",
  "Why this matters": "The hotel industry's profitability is increasingly tied to ancillary revenue, not just room rates. Competing effectively requires understanding the total value proposition of competitor offers. Deconstructing packages reveals their pricing strategy for high-margin services, allowing a hotel to create more compelling, profitable bundles and avoid a race-to-the-bottom on room prices alone.",
  "Implementation time": "10 to 12 weeks for initial setup, which included building custom scrapers for five key competitors, developing an NLP model for amenity extraction, and creating a pricing analysis dashboard for the client's revenue management team.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Inability to accurately price ancillary services against the market. 2) Losing bookings to competitor packages that appear to offer better value. 3) Difficulty in creating new, profitable packages due to a lack of data on what customers truly value. 4) Over-reliance on discounting base room rates, which erodes overall profitability.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Competitor hotel websites feature complex JavaScript, dynamic pricing calendars, and anti-scraping measures. An expert partner navigates these technical hurdles reliably. Furthermore, normalizing and analyzing the unstructured text of package descriptions (e.g., 'A Taste of Italy Dinner' vs. '$50 F&B Credit') requires sophisticated NLP and a structured data-mapping process that is beyond the scope of most in-house teams.",

  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to parse package descriptions and identify specific amenities (e.g., 'complimentary breakfast,' 'spa credit,' 'valet parking'). These identified amenities are then mapped to a standardized internal library. A pricing model estimates the standalone value of each amenity by scraping the hotel’s own service menus or using regional market averages, allowing for a calculation of the implied discount within the package.",
  "Story": "<p>Our client, a chain of upscale boutique hotels, faced a classic David vs. Goliath problem. They were competing in major urban markets against large, established hotel brands that had mastered the art of the 'package deal.' Their revenue management team felt they were constantly on the back foot. <strong>They were either losing direct bookings to competitors whose packages seemed more appealing, or they were aggressively discounting their own packages without knowing if they were leaving money on the table.</strong> The core issue was a lack of transparency; they could see a competitor's final package price, but they couldn't see the strategic thinking behind it. How much was that 'free' breakfast actually costing the competitor? Was the '$100 spa credit' a genuine value or just an upsell tactic?</p><p>This is where our team at Iceberg Data came in. We proposed a project that went far beyond standard room rate monitoring. Our goal was to systematically deconstruct and financially model every package deal offered by their top five competitors. We developed a highly customized web scraping infrastructure designed to navigate complex booking engines and promotions pages. Our crawlers were configured to collect not just the package price, but also the standalone room rate for the same dates, and, crucially, the full text description of every single perk included in the bundle.</p><p>The initial data collection was just the first step. The real breakthrough came from our analysis layer. <strong>We built an NLP model to parse the unstructured descriptions and categorize every amenity into a standardized library.</strong> 'A bottle of chilled prosecco upon arrival' and 'complimentary sparkling wine' were both mapped to 'Welcome Beverage.' 'Self-parking' and 'Valet' were categorized separately. Once we had this structured data, we performed a second scraping pass: we collected the publicly listed prices for these amenities from the competitors' own websites, like their spa menus, restaurant menus, and parking information pages. This allowed us to assign a real-world dollar value to each component of a package.</p><p>The insights were immediate and powerful. Our client discovered that their primary competitor's popular 'City Escape' package, which was only $50 more than the standard room rate, included valet parking (a $65 standalone value) and two breakfast vouchers (a $50 value). The competitor was taking a calculated loss on the ancillaries, betting they could secure a higher occupancy rate and make up the margin elsewhere. <strong>Another competitor's '$100 spa credit' was cleverly designed; we found that the lowest-priced treatment available was $175, making the credit an effective upsell tool rather than a free gift.</strong></p><p>Armed with this granular intelligence, our client's team transformed their strategy. They stopped competing on price and started competing on value. They identified that 'late checkout' was a low-cost, high-perceived-value perk and began incorporating it into their weekend packages to great effect. They created a new 'Work & Play' package that bundled premium Wi-Fi, a daily coffee shop credit, and one complimentary cocktail—a direct response to the data showing a gap in the market for business travelers extending their stays. The results were staggering. Within six months of implementing the strategy informed by our data, the client saw an <strong>18% increase in ancillary revenue per booking and a 5% lift in high-margin direct bookings</strong>, as their offers were now clearer, more compelling, and strategically priced against the competition.</p>",
