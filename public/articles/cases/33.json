  "Title": "Cracking Competitor DME Bundle Pricing to Boost Average Order Value by 20%",
  "Subtitle": "Using Web-Scraped Data to Decode Complex Product Bundles and Optimize Pricing Strategy for Home Medical Supplies",
  "Business Impact": "By analyzing competitor bundle strategies and associated pricing, our client identified underperforming product combinations and launched new, data-driven bundles, leading to a 20% increase in Average Order Value (AOV) and a 15% improvement in profit margins within six months.",
  "Sector": "Healthcare",
  "What data was collected": "List prices, sale prices, shipping costs, and stock availability for over 5,000 SKUs of Durable Medical Equipment (DME) from 15 key competitor websites. We also captured data on product bundles (e.g., 'Walker & Accessory Kit'), associated HCPCS reimbursement codes, and promotional banners.",
  "Why this matters": "In the DME market, customers often purchase related items together. Competitors leverage this by creating bundles that obscure individual item prices. Understanding these bundle strategies is critical for setting competitive prices, maximizing order value, and aligning offerings with common patient needs.",
  "Implementation time": "10 to 12 weeks. This included initial discovery, scraper development for complex e-commerce sites, creating a data pipeline for bundle analysis, and building a dashboard for the client's pricing team.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Inability to see competitor bundle pricing and discounts. 2) Lost revenue due to mispriced individual items that are frequently bundled by competitors. 3) Lack of insight into which products are most commonly purchased together across the market.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Competitor DME sites use dynamic pricing and anti-scraping technologies. A specialized partner like Iceberg Data can manage rotating proxies, handle complex JavaScript-rendered pages, and parse non-standardized data structures to consistently extract accurate pricing and bundle information, a task unfeasible for an in-house team without dedicated expertise.",

  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "We used a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) on product titles and descriptions and image similarity hashing to identify identical products across different competitor sites. For bundles, a proprietary algorithm analyzed product co-occurrence in 'Frequently Bought Together' sections and explicit bundle pages, grouping SKUs and calculating the effective discount against their individual sale prices.",
  "Story": "<p>Our client, a prominent online retailer of Durable Medical Equipment (DME), faced a challenge that was both subtle and existential. They were in a hyper-competitive market, selling everything from walkers and wheelchairs to complex respiratory equipment and disposable wound care supplies. Their problem wasn't a lack of products, but a lack of pricing intelligence. Their team spent countless hours manually checking competitor websites, but they were always one step behind. They could match the price of a standard wheelchair, but they couldn't figure out why they were still losing sales. The real battle, as we would soon discover, wasn't being fought over individual products, but over strategic product bundles.</p><p><strong>Competitors were masking their true pricing strategy within cleverly constructed bundles.</strong> A walker might be listed at a rock-bottom price, but it was often promoted alongside high-margin accessories like custom-fit bags, trays, and upgraded wheels. Customers, seeking convenience and value, were naturally drawn to these all-in-one packages. Our client was trying to compete on the price of the walker alone, completely missing the larger picture. Their manual process was too slow and superficial to decode these complex offers, leaving them vulnerable and unprofitable. They were losing the pricing war because they didn't even know where the front lines were.</p><p>This is where our team at Iceberg Data came in. We proposed a comprehensive competitive intelligence solution that went beyond simple price scraping. Our objective was to map the entire bundling ecosystem of their top 15 competitors. We developed and deployed a fleet of sophisticated web scrapers designed to navigate the complexities of modern e-commerce sites. These weren't simple HTML pages; we had to render JavaScript, manage dynamic pricing that changed based on user location, and bypass sophisticated anti-bot measures. <strong>Our scrapers were tasked with not just capturing the price of a product, but identifying every instance where it was bundled with other items.</strong> We targeted dedicated bundle pages, 'Frequently Bought Together' sections, and even promotional banners advertising special package deals.</p><p>The data we collected was vast and illuminating. For over 5,000 unique SKUs, we gathered list prices, sale prices, shipping costs, stock levels, and, most importantly, bundle compositions. We could see exactly which model of pressure relief cushion was most frequently bundled with which wheelchair, and the effective discount customers received. Our matching algorithms, which combined NLP for product descriptions and image hashing, allowed us to compare apples to apples, even when competitors used different product names or codes for the exact same item. We even captured publicly listed HCPCS reimbursement codes, giving the client insight into how bundles were positioned for insurance claims.</p><p>The analysis phase produced the 'aha' moment. We discovered that the most successful competitors weren't just bundling randomly; they were creating condition-specific 'starter kits.' For example, a 'Post-Hip Replacement Recovery Kit' would include a walker, a raised toilet seat, and a grabber tool. A 'Diabetic Foot Care Kit' would bundle specialized socks, inspection mirrors, and lotion. These bundles resonated with customers by addressing a complete need, not just selling a single product. <strong>Our data revealed a massive opportunity: our client's top-selling walker was being bundled with a specific tray and carry-pouch by 80% of their competitors, a combination they didn't offer at all.</strong></p><p>Armed with this intelligence, the client's pricing and marketing teams went to work. They dismantled their old pricing model and built a new one based on strategic bundling. They introduced their own 'Mobility Starter Kit' and a 'Monthly Wound Care Supply Pack,' pricing them competitively based on our data. The results were immediate and dramatic. Within six months, their Average Order Value (AOV) surged by 20% as customers embraced the convenience and value of the bundles. Because the bundles were strategically priced to protect core product margins while discounting accessories, their overall profit margin improved by a staggering 15%. By outsourcing this deep data intelligence work to us, they didn't just get a list of prices; they got a new, winning market strategy.</p>",
