  "Title": "Right-Sizing Specialty Vehicle Fleets Using Competitor Availability & Demand Signals",
  "Subtitle": "Leveraging Web-Scraped Competitor Fleet Data to Align Specialty Vehicle Supply with Latent Market Demand",
  "Business Impact": "Achieved a 22% increase in specialty vehicle utilization and a 15% reduction in cross-depot relocation costs by proactively matching inventory to real-time demand indicators.",
  "Sector": "Car Rental",
  "What data was collected": "Real-time vehicle availability and pricing by class (e.g., Convertible, Luxury Sedan, Full-Size SUV) from major competitor websites across 50+ airport and city locations. This was augmented with public data from event calendars, convention schedules, and flight arrival APIs.",
  "Why this matters": "Specialty vehicles have high profit margins but also high holding costs. Standard forecasting models based on historical data fail to predict demand spikes from unique, non-recurring events, leading to costly overstocking or missed revenue opportunities.",
  "Implementation time": "10 to 12 weeks, which included building resilient scrapers for multiple dynamic rental websites, integrating three distinct public data APIs, and creating a predictive demand-scoring model.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Chronic overstocking or understocking of high-margin specialty vehicles. 2) High operational costs from last-minute, reactive vehicle relocations between branches. 3) Inability to capitalize on hyper-local demand surges driven by conventions, festivals, or sports events.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Competitor car rental sites employ sophisticated anti-scraping measures, dynamic pricing engines, and complex user session management. An expert data partner like Iceberg Data can navigate these technical hurdles to ensure a consistent, structured, and reliable data stream for analysis.",

  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Geospatial mapping was used to link airport codes (e.g., 'SFO') and city names to competitor branch addresses within a 5-mile radius. Temporal correlation algorithms aligned public event calendars and flight arrival data with the booking date ranges being scraped. A custom NLP model classified disparate vehicle descriptions (e.g., 'Premium Elite Crossover', 'Large SUV') into standardized categories like 'Full-Size SUV' to ensure accurate, like-for-like competitor analysis.",
  "Story": "<p>Our client, a leading national car rental company, faced a persistent and costly challenge we called the <strong>'specialty fleet dilemma.'</strong> Their inventory of high-margin vehicles—convertibles, luxury sedans, and 12-passenger vans—was a constant source of operational friction. One week, their lots in Miami would be overflowing with unsold convertibles, accumulating holding costs. The next, a surprise convention in Atlanta would lead to a complete stockout of Full-Size SUVs, forcing them to turn away high-value corporate customers. Their forecasting was stuck in the past, relying solely on historical booking data, which was blind to future, one-off events.</p><p>The financial drain was significant. The logistics team was in a constant state of firefighting, executing expensive last-minute vehicle relocations between cities to plug inventory gaps. This reactive approach eroded the very profit margins the specialty fleet was supposed to generate. They were missing out on revenue during demand spikes and paying to store assets during lulls. They needed to move from a reactive to a predictive inventory management model.</p><p>Our team at Iceberg Data proposed a new strategy: the most reliable indicators of near-term demand weren't in their own historical data, but in the public digital ecosystem. Our hypothesis was that by monitoring <strong>competitor inventory levels, public event calendars, and flight schedules in real-time</strong>, we could build a highly accurate short-term demand forecast for specific vehicle classes at a hyper-local level.</p><p>We deployed a fleet of sophisticated web scrapers targeting the public-facing websites of our client's top three competitors. This was no simple task; these sites are armed with dynamic JavaScript calendars, CAPTCHAs, and session-based pricing that are designed to thwart automated access. Our team engineered resilient solutions to navigate these defenses, systematically collecting data points such as <code>vehicle_class</code>, <code>availability_status</code>, and <code>daily_rate</code> for future dates across dozens of key airport and downtown locations.</p><p>But that was only one piece of the puzzle. We then integrated this competitor data with several public APIs. We pulled data from major ticketing and convention sites to identify large-scale events. We ingested flight arrival data from airport authorities to anticipate large influxes of travelers. And we even incorporated long-range weather forecasts—a surprisingly powerful predictor for convertible rentals. Our <strong>matching algorithm</strong> was the core of the solution, standardizing messy vehicle descriptions from different competitors into clean categories and aligning event dates with rental booking windows.</p><p>The 'aha!' moment came about six weeks into the project. Our system flagged a developing situation in Las Vegas for a weekend two months out. A major international tech summit had just been announced. While our client's internal forecast showed normal demand, our scrapers revealed that two of their main competitors were already showing 'Low' or 'Sold Out' availability for the <code>Luxury Sedan</code> and <code>Full-Size SUV</code> classes for the summit dates. Their pricing for the few remaining vehicles had already surged by 60%.</p><p>Armed with this predictive insight, our client's operations team acted decisively. Instead of waiting for their own bookings to trickle in, they proactively relocated 40 luxury sedans from their Phoenix depot and 30 SUVs from Salt Lake City. They adjusted their pricing slightly below the competitor's surge rates. The result? They captured the massive wave of early bookings, achieving <strong>100% utilization</strong> for those vehicle classes during the event at a 45% higher margin. They transformed a potential stockout and missed opportunity into a significant revenue win.</p><p>Over six months, the results were transformative. Our client achieved a <strong>22% increase in overall specialty vehicle utilization.</strong> The data-driven relocation strategy meant that expensive, last-minute vehicle shuffling was drastically reduced, cutting cross-depot logistics costs by <strong>15%</strong>. Most importantly, they shifted their entire operational mindset from reactive to proactive, using external data to skate to where the puck was going, not where it had been.</p>",
