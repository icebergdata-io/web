  "Title": "Cross-Border Price Optimization through Public Duty & Tax Data",
  "Subtitle": "Scraping Customs Websites for Up-to-Date Fees, Ensuring Competitive Global Pricing",
  "Business Impact": "Tracking published duty rates and national import fees improves international sales by 15-20%, as customers see accurate, transparent total costs.",
  "Sector": "Ecommerce",
  "What data was collected": "Public customs tariff information, official tax rates from government sites, competitor shipping rates, and user-reported issues in cross-border shopping forums.",
  "Why this matters": "International buyers often abandon carts when final costs (duties, VAT) aren’t clear upfront. Scraping official public data ensures accurate landing costs and fosters trust.",
  "Implementation time": "6 to 10 weeks, focusing on building scrapers for government tariff databases, aggregator sites, and competitor shipping info, plus currency conversion integration.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Surprise fees that drive customers to abandon. 2) Outdated manual checks for duties or shipping surcharges. 3) Inability to benchmark competitor cross-border strategies effectively.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "An external web scraping provider can reliably handle complex government site structures and handle data updates as regulations change, guaranteeing continuous compliance and accuracy.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object specifying target countries, relevant product categories, and shipping weight thresholds. Example: { 'countries': ['Canada', 'UK'], 'product_categories': ['Electronics'], 'weight_ranges_kg': [0-2, 2-5] }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON object for each country listing import duty rates, VAT percentages, competitor shipping approaches, and recommended final prices. Example: { 'country': 'Canada', 'import_duty': 5.0, 'vat': 2.5, 'recommended_price': 80.00 }",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "HS codes and product categories are matched against official tariff tables. The system cross-references competitor shipping details to create a total landed cost suggestion.",
  "Story": "A mid-range fashion brand started receiving global traffic to its online store but saw low conversion rates in cross-border checkouts. Customers complained on social media that final shipping costs and duties were unclear. The company hired a web scraping team to systematically gather up-to-date duty and tax data from government portals in Canada, the UK, and the EU. They also scraped competitor websites—publicly visible shipping calculators or check-out pages—to see how others displayed cross-border pricing. Powered by these combined data sets, the brand integrated a real-time landed cost module: at checkout, international customers now saw a precise breakdown of product price, import duty, local tax, and shipping fees. By showcasing accurate final costs, cart abandonment dropped dramatically. The web scraping agency maintained compliance with government site usage policies and updated data whenever tariff policies shifted. Meanwhile, the brand’s internal teams focused on marketing and fulfilling new international orders, confident that pricing remained transparent. Ultimately, converting public customs data into a user-friendly display gave the brand a significant competitive edge, boosting international sales and brand loyalty among cross-border shoppers.",
