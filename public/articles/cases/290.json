  "Title": "Slashing Perishable Amenity Spoilage by 15% via Hyper-Local Supplier Data Aggregation",
  "Subtitle": "Optimizing the 'Farm-to-Room' Supply Chain for Luxury Guest Experiences",
  "Business Impact": "Achieved a 15% reduction in perishable amenity spoilage and a 10% decrease in last-minute procurement costs by dynamically matching guest booking forecasts with real-time local supplier inventory data.",
  "Sector": "Hotels",
  "What data was collected": "Public inventory levels and pricing from local farm, chocolatier, and artisan supplier websites; delivery schedules from regional logistics partner portals; local event calendars impacting demand; and competitor hotel amenity offerings mentioned in public reviews.",
  "Why this matters": "For luxury hotels, the quality and freshness of guest amenities are powerful brand differentiators. A data-driven supply chain prevents waste, ensures a consistent high-quality guest experience, and controls the volatile costs associated with these high-value, short-shelf-life items.",
  "Implementation time": "10 to 12 weeks, involving the creation of targeted scrapers for dozens of small, non-standardized supplier websites, integration with the client's booking system API, and development of a predictive demand-sourcing dashboard.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) High spoilage rates for fresh flowers, fruits, and artisanal goods. 2) Inconsistent amenity quality due to unreliable supplier availability. 3) Inflated operational costs from urgent, last-minute sourcing and premium delivery fees.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Scraping data from a multitude of small, disparate local supplier websites—each with unique structures, no APIs, and frequent updates—requires robust, adaptable scraping technology and constant maintenance. This specialized data acquisition and management is far outside the core competency of a hotel operations team.",

  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "A weighted scoring algorithm was developed to generate procurement recommendations. It considers scraped data points like supplier inventory levels, price, and delivery ETA. This is fused with internal data from the client's booking system, such as occupancy forecasts and VIP guest arrivals. The algorithm calculates a 'recommendation_score' to prioritize suppliers who can meet forecasted demand with the lowest cost and spoilage risk.",
  "Story": "<p>Our client, a prestigious luxury hotel group, had built its brand on offering an authentic, hyper-local guest experience. A key part of this strategy involved placing fresh, locally sourced amenities in guest rooms upon arrival: bouquets of flowers from nearby farms, platters of artisanal cheeses, and small bottles of wine from regional vineyards. While delightful for guests, this program was an operational and financial nightmare. The core problem was a complete lack of visibility into a fragmented and non-digitized local supply chain.</p><p>Procurement managers were essentially flying blind. They relied on phone calls and outdated paper catalogs, leading to constant uncertainty. <strong>This resulted in two costly outcomes: over-ordering to avoid shortages, which led to significant spoilage of perishable goods, or under-ordering, which triggered expensive, last-minute courier services to fulfill amenities for high-value guests.</strong> The client estimated that nearly 20% of their perishable amenity budget was being lost to waste and rush delivery fees. The guest experience, the very thing the program was designed to enhance, was also suffering from inconsistency.</p><p>Our team at Iceberg Data was brought in to create a data-driven solution. We proposed a system that would provide real-time visibility into the hyper-local supply chain. The first challenge was the data sources themselves. We weren't dealing with large distributors with sophisticated APIs; we were targeting dozens of small, independent farms, creameries, and wineries. Many had simple websites with publicly visible, but unstructured, inventory or product pages.</p><p>We deployed a fleet of highly customized web scrapers designed to navigate these diverse sites. Our scrapers were programmed to identify and extract critical data points: <strong>`item_name`, `available_units`, `unit_price`, and any mentions of delivery lead times.</strong> We also scraped data from local logistics providers to understand their daily delivery schedules and capacity. To complete the picture, we integrated this external data with the client's internal booking system, pulling anonymized occupancy forecasts and VIP arrival schedules for the coming weeks.</p><p>The collected data fed into a central dashboard our team developed for their procurement managers. Instead of making dozens of phone calls, a manager could now see a unified view of all available local products. Our matching algorithm would cross-reference the hotel's forecasted demand for, say, 70 bouquets of peonies over a weekend, with the real-time scraped inventory from all local flower farms. It would then generate a prioritized list of suppliers, ranked by a `recommendation_score` that balanced price, availability, and delivery speed.</p><p><strong>The impact was immediate and profound.</strong> Within the first quarter of implementation, the hotel group was able to reduce perishable amenity spoilage by 15%. The dashboard allowed them to shift from a 'just-in-case' inventory model to a 'just-in-time' model. For example, by seeing that a particular creamery had low stock of a popular cheese ahead of a holiday weekend, they could proactively source a similar high-quality product from an alternative supplier well in advance, avoiding both a stock-out and last-minute rush fees. This foresight cut their emergency procurement costs by over 10%. Ultimately, we transformed their supply chain from a reactive cost center into a proactive, data-informed strategic asset that consistently delivered on their brand promise.</p>",
