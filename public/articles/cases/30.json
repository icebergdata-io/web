  "Title": "Price Sensitivity Analysis using Public Competitor Offer Scraping",
  "Subtitle": "Refining Price Points by Monitoring Discount Trends",
  "Business Impact": "Tuning prices based on real-time competitor promotions—scraped from public sites—can raise profit margins by 5-10% without sacrificing market share.",
  "Sector": "Market Analytics",
  "What data was collected": "Public discount codes, banner ads, competitor homepage deals, user posts referencing sale events, and list prices for comparable products.",
  "Why this matters": "If a competitor repeatedly discounts certain products, your pricing strategy can adapt accordingly to maintain appeal and profitability.",
  "Implementation time": "6 to 8 weeks, including the building of discount code scrapers, price trackers, and a dynamic modeling system for recommended price adjustments.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Setting prices in isolation without knowledge of competitor promos. 2) Slow reaction to big discount windows that drive competitor sales. 3) Inconsistent margin control during market fluctuations.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "A specialized web scraping provider ensures continuous, error-free scraping of competitor promotional pages, capturing short-lived deals or banner changes that might otherwise go unnoticed.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object specifying competitor sites, product IDs, and discount code triggers. Example: { 'competitor_urls': ['retailerA.com', 'retailerB.com'], 'product_skus': ['SKU123'], 'discount_keywords': ['Sale', 'Coupon'] }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON object with competitor discounts, recommended price or discount adjustments, and forecasted margin changes. Example: { 'sku': 'SKU123', 'competitor_discount': 20, 'suggested_adjustment': 15, 'margin_impact': 0.07 }",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Product SKUs or close matches (via product name and attributes) are mapped. Discount code text or banner announcements are extracted, then fed into a price elasticity model.",
  "Story": "An online retailer’s pricing team struggled to maintain market-competitive rates during seasonal promotions. While scanning competitor sites manually helped occasionally, they often missed flash sales or influencer-exclusive coupon codes. By contracting a web scraping agency, they set up automated monitors that refreshed competitor data multiple times per day, capturing any mention of new discount codes or short-term price drops. The scraped data fed into a real-time elasticity model. Whenever competitor X slashed a popular item’s price by 20%, the system either recommended matching or offered a slightly lower discount, factoring in the retailer’s brand positioning. Over a span of weeks, the retailer discovered that competitor B ran deep discounts only during specific weekdays—a pattern that, once recognized, allowed for strategic response. Outsourcing the scraping part spared the retailer from building a high-maintenance system internally. They simply plugged the incoming data into their existing analytics tool. The result was more confident, rapid, and data-backed decisions on pricing adjustments, boosting overall profitability while preserving a competitive edge in the market.",
