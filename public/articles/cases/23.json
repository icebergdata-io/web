  "Title": "Personalized Recommendation Engine via Public Review Scraping",
  "Subtitle": "Extracting User Sentiments to Refine E-Commerce Product Recommendations",
  "Business Impact": "Tailored product suggestions can increase average order value by 10-15%. Scraping public reviews for competitor products reveals key attributes that matter most to customers.",
  "Sector": "Ecommerce",
  "What data was collected": "Competitor product reviews on public marketplaces, rating summaries, social media opinions, and popular feature keywords relevant to each category.",
  "Why this matters": "Understanding common praises or complaints for similar items helps e-commerce sites highlight the right product attributes, improving relevance and upsell rates.",
  "Implementation time": "8 to 12 weeks, covering the deployment of review scrapers, text analysis for feature extraction, and integration with the site’s recommendation engine.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Generic recommendations that ignore emerging trends or sentiments. 2) Inability to tailor product suggestions for customers seeking specific features. 3) Overreliance on internal reviews or incomplete data sets.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "A specialized scraping partner can parse large volumes of competitor reviews from public marketplaces at scale, ensuring the personalization engine always reflects real-world user preferences.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object listing competitor marketplace URLs, product category pages, and sentiment-related keywords. Example: { 'marketplace_links': ['https://shopA.com/electronics'], 'categories': ['headphones'], 'sentiment_keywords': ['sound quality', 'battery life'] }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON object summarizing top customer priorities, potential product improvements, and recommended cross-sells. Example: { 'top_features': ['noise cancelling', 'battery'], 'common_issues': ['uncomfortable fit'], 'cross_sell_opportunities': ['headphone cases'] }",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "A topic modeling approach clusters review text into feature mentions. The personalization engine maps these features to the site’s product listings for dynamic recommendations.",
  "Story": "A rising online electronics retailer wanted to step up its personalized shopping experience. Though it had basic data on its own product line, it lacked deep insights into what external customers valued—especially if they shopped on competitor marketplaces. To fill this gap, the retailer partnered with a web scraping agency that specialized in extracting publicly visible reviews on major platforms. The scrapers captured star ratings and free-form text about competitor headphones, tablets, and accessories. Using text analysis, the agency uncovered that battery life was consistently a top concern for headphone buyers, while design comfort came in second. Armed with these insights, the retailer adjusted its recommendation engine to highlight battery specs and earcup ergonomics. When returning customers looked at new headphones, the system automatically suggested top-rated models from the brand’s inventory boasting all-day battery life. Upsell options, like protective cases or travel chargers, were introduced at checkout. Post-launch metrics showed a noticeable bump in average cart values. Because the partner handled the labor-intensive scraping, the retailer’s internal data science team could focus on refining the algorithms and brand messaging. Overall, leveraging competitor review data from public sources gave the retailer a real-time lens on consumer trends, fueling more tailored product suggestions and higher customer satisfaction.",
