  "Title": "Slashing Vehicle Downtime by 20% by Proactively Sourcing OEM Spare Parts",
  "Subtitle": "Leveraging real-time supplier inventory data to preemptively address maintenance needs and keep more cars on the road.",
  "Business Impact": "Reduced average vehicle downtime from 72 hours to 58 hours, a 20% improvement. This led to a 5% increase in fleet availability during peak seasons and a 12% reduction in express shipping costs for emergency parts.",
  "Sector": "Car Rental",
  "What data was collected": "Public inventory levels and stock-keeping unit (SKU) data from multiple Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and aftermarket auto parts supplier portals. We also collected part compatibility information, list prices, and estimated shipping times from their public-facing product pages.",
  "Why this matters": "A car that isn't on the road is a depreciating asset that generates zero revenue. Proactively sourcing parts before a vehicle even enters the garage for scheduled maintenance minimizes downtime, maximizes fleet utilization, and prevents reliance on costly last-minute logistics.",
  "Implementation time": "10 to 12 weeks. This included building custom scrapers for over 50 different supplier portals, creating a unified parts database, and integrating the data feed into the client's existing fleet management system via API.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Unexpected vehicle downtime due to unavailable parts. 2) High costs associated with expedited shipping for emergency repairs. 3) Inefficient maintenance scheduling based on guesswork rather than confirmed parts availability. 4) Lost revenue from having a smaller available fleet.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Supplier websites have vastly different structures, anti-bot protections, and update schedules. An expert web scraping partner manages this complexity, ensuring a consistent, reliable, and normalized data stream from hundreds of sources without diverting the client's internal IT resources from their core business.",

  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Data was normalized using a custom SKU and manufacturer part number (MPN) matching system. Scraped product descriptions were processed with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to validate part compatibility against the client's vehicle fleet database, ensuring a match accuracy of over 99%.",
  "Story": "<p>When a leading national car rental company approached our team at Iceberg Data, they didn't have a sales or marketing problem. They had a logistics nightmare disguised as a maintenance issue. Their primary challenge was vehicle downtime. For every hour a car sat in their service bay waiting for a part, they were losing revenue and frustrating customers with limited vehicle availability. Their existing process was entirely reactive: a car would come in for service, a technician would diagnose the issue, and only then would the parts department begin the frantic, manual search for the necessary components. This involved checking a dozen different supplier websites, making phone calls, and often resorting to expensive overnight shipping to get a car back on the road. The average vehicle was out of commission for <strong>over 72 hours</strong> for even routine repairs, a number that was simply unsustainable.</p><p>Our hypothesis was that we could flip their entire model from reactive to proactive. What if their fleet management system knew which parts were needed for upcoming scheduled maintenance and, more importantly, knew the real-time inventory levels of those parts across their entire supplier network? This would allow them to order parts just-in-time, ensuring they arrived at the service center before the vehicle even pulled into the bay. It was an ambitious supply chain optimization project, and web data was the key.</p><p>Our first step was to work with their operations team to identify their top 50 most critical OEM and aftermarket parts suppliers. These were the public-facing e-commerce portals they used every day. Our team then built a fleet of custom web scrapers, each one tailored to navigate the unique architecture of a supplier's site. We weren't just grabbing prices; we were tasked with capturing a specific set of data points: the exact Stock-Keeping Unit (SKU), the manufacturer part number, real-time stock levels, list price, and estimated delivery times to their key service hubs. We configured these scrapers to run multiple times a day to ensure the data was always fresh.</p><p>The real magic happened during integration. We created a unified, clean data feed and delivered it via API directly into their proprietary fleet management software. Now, when a service manager scheduled a 30,000-mile service for a 2022 Ford Explorer, the system didn't just generate a work order. It automatically queried our data feed for all necessary parts, like the <strong>cabin air filter with SKU 'FL3Z-19N619-A'</strong>. Instead of seeing a simple checklist, the manager saw a dashboard showing that 'OEM Parts Direct' had 112 units in stock at $18.50 with a 2-day delivery, while 'National Auto Supply' had only 45 units at a slightly lower price but a 3-day delivery. The system could be configured to automatically order from the cheapest supplier that met the delivery deadline.</p><p>The 'aha' moment for the client came about a month after implementation. Their system flagged a regional shortage of a specific brake caliper for their fleet of Toyota Camrys. The data showed that most local suppliers were out of stock. However, our system found a large supply at a distribution center three states away with a standard 4-day shipping time. The system automatically placed a bulk order to replenish their central parts depot. Two weeks later, when a wave of Camrys came in for service, the parts were already on the shelves. Previously, this scenario would have resulted in dozens of cars being sidelined for days, leading to a significant revenue loss over the busy weekend. Instead, the workflow was seamless.</p><p>The results were transformative. Within six months, the client had reduced their average vehicle downtime from 72 hours to just under 58 hoursâ€”a <strong>20% reduction</strong>. This operational efficiency directly translated into a <strong>5% increase in fleet-wide vehicle availability</strong>, allowing them to capture more bookings during peak demand periods. Furthermore, by eliminating the need for last-minute, panicked orders, they cut their expedited shipping expenditures by 12%. This project demonstrated that for the car rental industry, supply chain and logistics optimization isn't just a back-office function; it's a primary driver of revenue and customer satisfaction.</p>",
