  "Business Impact": "Increased sales by 15-25% and reduced launch failures by up to 40% due to data-backed pricing decisions driven by real-time competitive analysis.",
  "Sector": "Retail",
  "What data was collected": "We collected competitor pricing data, product availability, promotional offers, and customer reviews from various e-commerce platforms and competitor websites.",
  "Why this matters": "Real-time pricing intelligence enables retailers to make informed decisions about pricing strategies, optimize product positioning, and respond quickly to market changes.",
  "Implementation time": "6-8 weeks. Time was spent collecting competitor data, setting up automated alerts, and integrating pricing data into the client's pricing system. This allowed automated price updates and responses.",
  "Problems this solves": "1. Difficulty monitoring competitor prices across multiple platforms. 2. Inaccurate pricing due to lack of real-time data. 3. Inability to respond quickly to competitor price changes. 4. Missed opportunities to optimize pricing and maximize revenue.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Outsourcing allows retailers to focus on core business operations while leveraging Iceberg Data's expertise in data collection, processing, and analysis.
