  "Title": "Cross-Border Price Optimization through Public Duty & Tax Data",
  "Subtitle": "Scraping Customs Websites for Up-to-Date Fees, Ensuring Competitive Global Pricing",
  "Business Impact": "Tracking published duty rates and national import fees improves international sales by 15-20%, as customers see accurate, transparent total costs.",
  "Sector": "E-commerce",
  "What data was collected": "Public customs tariff information, official tax rates from government sites, competitor shipping rates, and user-reported issues in cross-border shopping forums.",
  "Why this matters": "International buyers often abandon carts when final costs (duties, VAT) arenâ€™t clear upfront. Scraping official public data ensures accurate landing costs and fosters trust.",
  "Implementation time": "6 to 10 weeks, focusing on building scrapers for government tariff databases, aggregator sites, and competitor shipping info, plus currency conversion integration.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Surprise fees that drive customers to abandon. 2) Outdated manual checks for duties or shipping surcharges. 3) Inability to benchmark competitor cross-border strategies effectively.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "An external web scraping provider can reliably handle complex government site structures and handle data updates as regulations change, guaranteeing continuous compliance and accuracy.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object specifying target countries, relevant product categories, and shipping weight thresholds. Example: { 'countries': ['Canada', 'UK'], 'product_categories': ['Electronics'], 'weight_ranges_kg': [0-2, 2-5] }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON object for each country listing import duty rates, VAT percentages, competitor shipping approaches, and recommended final prices. Example: { 'country': 'Canada', 'import_duty': 5.0, 'vat': 2.5, 'recommended_price': 80.00 }",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "HS codes and product categories are matched against official tariff tables. The system cross-references competitor shipping details to create a total landed cost suggestion.",
  "Story": "<p>For a mid-range fashion brand expanding globally, unclear cross-border costs posed a significant challenge. Despite growing international web traffic, the company saw high cart abandonment rates as shoppers complained about opaque duties and shipping fees. To provide transparent pricing and boost global sales, the brand partnered with Iceberg Data's web scraping experts.</p>\n\n<p>Iceberg Data systematically collected up-to-date customs data from official government sites in the brand's key markets: Canada, the UK, and the EU. The scraping solution handled complex source formats, ensuring accurate import duties and tax rates. To benchmark competitor strategies, Iceberg Data also scraped publicly available shipping details from other retailers.</p>\n\n<p>Leveraging these aggregated data sets, Iceberg Data integrated a powerful landed cost display for the fashion brand's international checkout. Key components included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Matching product categories against official tariff tables via HS codes</li>\n  <li>Displaying import duties, VAT percentages, and shipping fees for each country</li>\n  <li>Calculating recommended final prices based on competitor benchmarking</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The solution was built to handle diverse inputs, from target markets and weight ranges to product types, as specified in a flexible JSON schema. A corresponding JSON output provided the client with structured pricing data for each country. Iceberg Data's algorithms dynamically matched these inputs against scraped customs data to generate precise landed costs.</p>\n\n<p>By showcasing fully transparent cross-border prices, the brand saw a dramatic reduction in international cart abandonment. Iceberg Data's solution automatically updated duty and tax data, allowing the fashion retailer to focus on fulfillment and marketing while ensuring compliance. <strong>With Iceberg Data's support, the company ultimately achieved a 15-20% increase in global sales and fostered lasting customer loyalty among international shoppers.</strong></p>",
