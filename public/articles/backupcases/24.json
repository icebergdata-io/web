  "Title": "Reducing Returns by Scraping Public Complaints",
  "Subtitle": "Tracking Why Customers Return Items through Forums and Review Posts",
  "Business Impact": "By understanding common return triggers—stated publicly on consumer forums or marketplace reviews—e-commerce stores can reduce return rates by up to 20%.",
  "Sector": "E-commerce",
  "What data was collected": "Public forum discussions on product quality, shipping damage complaints, competitor return policies posted online, and negative review highlights from aggregator sites.",
  "Why this matters": "Returns eat into margins and can erode brand trust. Analyzing publicly shared grievances offers a broader, unbiased picture of real user frustrations—beyond only your own returns data.",
  "Implementation time": "8 to 10 weeks, encompassing the creation of forum scrapers, classification of complaint reasons, and final integration into continuous improvement workflows.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Blind reliance on limited internal return logs. 2) Lack of comparative insight into how other retailers reduce return risk. 3) Missed signals on packaging or shipping issues that appear in competitor complaints.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "A specialized scraping company navigates diverse forums, Q&A sites, and review hubs, ensuring full coverage of public discussions while respecting each platform’s policies.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object specifying forum URLs, competitor brand keywords, and return-related triggers. Example: { 'forums': ['Reddit/r/ecommerce', 'CommunitySite.com'], 'competitor_brands': ['BrandX'], 'complaint_triggers': ['return policy', 'wrong item'] }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON object listing top return reasons, competitor policy comparisons, and recommended interventions. Example: { 'common_reasons': ['size mismatch', 'poor packaging'], 'competitor_policies': [...], 'improvement_suggestions': [...] }",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "A text mining model keyed to return-related phrases. Complaints referencing competitor brand names are collated to show how different policies or product attributes affect consumer satisfaction.",
