  "Title": "White Space Detection by Tracking Public Brand Presence",
  "Subtitle": "Uncovering Underserved Markets through Competitor Location Listings",
  "Business Impact": "Identifying geographic or demographic ‘white space’ can lead to a 15-25% revenue boost when businesses expand into areas with little direct competition.",
  "Sector": "Market Analytics",
  "What data was collected": "Public store locators on competitor websites, brand presence data on Google Maps, user queries about regional product availability, and population/demographic info from public records.",
  "Why this matters": "Knowing exactly where competitors dominate or underperform helps companies expand into locations where demand is high and rival coverage is thin.",
  "Implementation time": "6 to 10 weeks, involving competitor store locator scraping, demographic data correlation, and a mapping module that highlights potential market gaps.",
  "Problems this solves": "1) Random site selection or expansion without competitor insight. 2) Overcrowded markets that lead to high competition and low margins. 3) Missed opportunities in regions where demand remains unfulfilled.",
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "A specialized scraping team can systematically collect competitor location data from public ‘Find a Store’ pages, ensuring accuracy and minimal manual overhead for your analytics staff.",
  "Input Schema": "A JSON object listing competitor store locator URLs, demographic metrics to fetch, and region filters. Example: { 'competitor_locators': ['CompetitorX.com/locations'], 'demographics': ['median_income'], 'regions': ['CA', 'TX'] }",
  "Output Schema": "A JSON object mapping competitor coverage density, regional demand indicators, and recommended entry points. Example: { 'region': 'Northern California', 'competitor_coverage': 'Low', 'demand_score': 0.9, 'entry_suggestions': [...] }",
  "Matching algorithm used to integrate the data": "Competitor store coordinates are pinned on a map, then overlaid with demographic layers from public records, factoring in population size and median income for a composite ‘white space’ score.",
  "Story": "<p>For retailers, uncovering untapped markets is a critical growth driver, but identifying these opportunities requires deep competitive insights. When a sustainable home goods brand sought to expand into new regions, they needed a data-driven approach to assess the competitive landscape and pinpoint underserved areas with strong demand potential.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, mapping out competitor presence would involve manual searches and aggregation, a time-consuming and error-prone process. However, Iceberg Data's web scraping experts offered an innovative solution: <strong>automatically extracting store locations from competitors' 'Find a Store' pages</strong>. By defining the store locator URLs and desired demographic filters, the retailer gained a comprehensive view of rival footprints across target regions.</p>\n\n<p>Iceberg Data's web scraping team delivered the extracted location data in a structured JSON format, including:\n<ul>\n  <li>Competitor coverage density by region</li>\n  <li>Demographic indicators like median income and population density</li>\n  <li>Recommended entry points based on demand scores</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>Behind the scenes, Iceberg Data's <strong>proprietary location matching algorithm</strong> pinpointed competitor coordinates, overlaying demographic data to calculate a composite 'white space' score for each region. This systematic approach eliminated guesswork and manual analysis, surfacing Northern California as a prime expansion opportunity with <strong>high demand but minimal competitor presence</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Armed with these data-driven insights, the retailer confidently launched a pilot store in the identified region, fine-tuning its product mix and marketing to resonate with the eco-conscious consumer base. The store quickly gained traction, <strong>with sales outpacing projections and validating the opportunity spotted by Iceberg Data's analysis</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>By partnering with Iceberg Data, the sustainable home goods brand unlocked a <strong>15-25% revenue boost from expanding into an untapped market</strong>. The combination of precision web scraping and intelligent location matching empowered the retailer to grow its footprint strategically, even in a fiercely competitive industry. Today, Iceberg Data's location intelligence solution remains a cornerstone of the brand's expansion strategy, guiding smart, sustainable growth in the ever-evolving retail landscape.</p>",
