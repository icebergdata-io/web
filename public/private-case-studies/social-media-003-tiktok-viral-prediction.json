  "Business Impact": "Increased brand reach by 300%, improved engagement rates by 85%, and achieved 12 viral videos (1M+ views) through predictive trend analysis",
  "Sector": "Social Media - TikTok",
  "Platform": "TikTok",
  "Use Case": "viral content pattern analysis",
  "What data was collected": "TikTok video data including hashtags, music trends, engagement metrics, posting times, content categories, and viral patterns across 100,000+ videos",

    "2) Predicts optimal posting times based on audience activity patterns",
