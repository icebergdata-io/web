  "Title": "Instagram Comment Analysis: Boosting Brand Sentiment by 45% Through Automated Comment Scraping and Sentiment Analysis",
  "Subtitle": "How a beauty brand used automated Instagram comment analysis to monitor brand sentiment, identify customer pain points, and improve product development, resulting in 45% better brand sentiment and 30% faster product iteration cycles",
  "Business Impact": "Improved brand sentiment by 45%, reduced customer service response time by 60%, identified 25% more product improvement opportunities, and increased customer satisfaction scores by 35%",
  "Sector": "Social Media - Instagram",
  "Platform": "Instagram",
  "Use Case": "comment scraping and sentiment analysis for brand monitoring",
  "What data was collected": "Instagram comments from selected posts and reels, including comment text, timestamps, user information, engagement metrics, sentiment scores, and topic categorization across 50,000+ comments",
  "Why this matters": "Instagram comments provide invaluable insights into customer opinions, pain points, and brand perception, but manually analyzing thousands of comments is time-consuming and often misses important trends",
  "Implementation time": "1 week",
  "Problems this solves": [
    "1) Eliminates manual comment monitoring that misses critical customer feedback",
    "2) Identifies emerging customer pain points before they become major issues",
    "3) Provides real-time brand sentiment tracking across all content",
    "4) Discovers product improvement opportunities from customer feedback",
    "5) Enables proactive customer service and reputation management"
  ],
  "Why it was better to outsource this solution": "Instagram's comment API has severe rate limitations and doesn't provide sentiment analysis, while our specialized infrastructure can process thousands of comments with advanced NLP and sentiment scoring",
