  "Story": "<p>A fashion brand was struggling to gain traction on TikTok despite creating quality content. Their videos were getting lost in the algorithm, and they couldn't understand why some content performed well while others flopped.</p><p>The brand partnered with Iceberg Data to implement a comprehensive TikTok trend analysis system. Our solution analyzed over 100,000 TikTok videos, collecting data on hashtags, music trends, engagement metrics, posting times, and content categories.</p><p>The system used machine learning algorithms to identify patterns that predicted viral success. By analyzing engagement velocity and hashtag growth patterns, we could identify trending topics before they peaked, giving the brand a competitive advantage.</p><p>The results were remarkable: brand reach increased by 300%, engagement rates improved by 85%, and the brand achieved 12 viral videos with over 1 million views each. The brand now creates content based on predicted trends rather than following them, positioning themselves as trendsetters rather than followers.</p>",
