## Understanding the Results

### Index Status: PASS
The URL is successfully indexed by Google and can appear in search results.

### Index Status: FAIL
The URL is not indexed. Common reasons:
- Blocked by robots.txt
- Noindex meta tag
- Low quality content
- Duplicate content
- Crawl errors

### Performance Data: null
No performance data means the URL hasn't received any search traffic in the last 30 days. This is normal for:
- New pages
- Pages with low search visibility
- Internal pages

## CSV Format

The CSV files include the following columns for easy analysis:
1. URL
2. Index Status (PASS/FAIL/UNKNOWN)
3. Coverage State
4. Last Crawl Date

8. Avg Position
